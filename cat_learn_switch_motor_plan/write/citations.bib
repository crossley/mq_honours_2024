	abstract = {A feature of human cognition is the ability to monitor and adjust one’s own behavior under changing circumstances. A dynamic balance between controlled and rapid responding is needed to adapt to a ﬂuctuating environment. We suggest that cognitive control may include, among other things, two distinct processes. Incongruent stimuli may drive top-down facilitation of task-relevant responses to bias performance toward exploitation vs. exploration. Task or response switches may generally slow responses to bias toward accuracy vs. speed and exploration vs. exploitation. Behavioral results from a task switching study demonstrate these two distinct processes as revealed by higher-order sequential eﬀects. A computational model implements the two conﬂict-control mechanisms, which allow it to capture many complex and novel sequential eﬀects. Lesion studies with the model demonstrate that the model is unable to capture these eﬀects without the conﬂict-control loops and show how each monitoring component modulates cognitive control. The results suggest numerous testable predictions regarding the neural substrates of cognitive control.},

Learning from feedback thus informs us not only about the value of stimulus-action associations but also about which rule set applies. Hierarchical clustering models suggest that learners discover structure in the environment, clustering distinct sensory events into a single latent rule set. Such structure enables a learner to transfer any newly acquired information to other contexts linked to the same rule set, and facilitates re-use of learned knowledge in novel contexts. Here, we show that humans exhibit this transfer, generalization and clustering during learning. Trial-by-trial model-based analysis of EEG signals revealed that subjects’ reward expectations incorporated this hierarchical structure; these structured neural signals were predictive of behavioral transfer and clustering. These results further our understanding of how humans learn and generalize ﬂexibly by building abstract, behaviorally relevant representations of the complex, high-dimensional sensory environment.},

Behavioral studies show that humans impute structure into simple learning problems, even when this tendency affords no behavioral advantage. Here we used electroencephalography to investigate the neural dynamics indicative of such incidental latent structure. Event-related potentials over lateral prefrontal cortex, typically observed for instructed task rules, were stratified according to individual participants' constructed rule sets. Moreover, this individualized latent rule structure could be independently decoded from multielectrode pattern classification. Both neural markers were predictive of participants' ability to subsequently generalize rule structure to new contexts. These EEG dynamics reveal that the human brain spontaneously constructs hierarchically structured representations during learning of simple task rules.},

	abstract = {Learning and executive functions such as task-switching share common neural substrates, notably prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia. Understanding how they interact requires studying how cognitive control facilitates learning but also how learning provides the (potentially hidden) structure, such as abstract rules or task-sets, needed for cognitive control. We investigate this question from 3 complementary angles. First, we develop a new context-task-set (C-TS) model, inspired by nonparametric Bayesian methods, specifying how the learner might infer hidden structure (hierarchical rules) and decide to reuse or create new structure in novel situations. Second, we develop a neurobiologically explicit network model to assess mechanisms of such structured learning in hierarchical frontal cortex and basal ganglia circuits. We systematically explore the link between these modeling levels across task demands. We find that the network provides an approximate implementation of high-level C-TS computations, with specific neural mechanisms modulating distinct C-TS parameters. Third, this synergism yields predictions about the nature of human optimal and suboptimal choices and response times during learning and task-switching. In particular, the models suggest that participants spontaneously build task-set structure into a learning problem when not cued to do so, which predicts positive and negative transfer in subsequent generalization tests. We provide experimental evidence for these predictions and show that C-TS provides a good quantitative fit to human sequences of choices. These findings implicate a strong tendency to interactively engage cognitive control and learning, resulting in structured abstract representations that afford generalization opportunities and, thus, potentially long-term rather than short-term optimality.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Human learning is highly efficient and flexible. A key contributor to this learning flexibility is our ability to generalize new information across contexts that we know require the same behavior and to transfer rules to new contexts we encounter. To do this, we structure the information we learn and represent it hierarchically as abstract, context-dependent rules that constrain lower-level stimulus–action–outcome contingencies. Previous research showed that humans create such structure even when it is not needed, presumably because it usually affords long-term generalization benefits. However, computational models predict that creating structure is costly, with slower learning and slower RTs. We tested this prediction in a new behavioral experiment. Participants learned to select correct actions for four visual patterns, in a setting that either afforded (but did not promote) structure learning or enforced nonhierarchical learning, while controlling for the difficulty of the learning problem. Results replicated our previous finding that healthy young adults create structure even when unneeded and that this structure affords later generalization. Furthermore, they supported our prediction that structure learning incurred a major learning cost and that this cost was specifically tied to the effort in selecting abstract rules, leading to more errors when applying those rules. These findings confirm our theory that humans pay a high short-term cost in learning structure to enable longer-term benefits in learning flexibility.},

This hypothesis was tested by giving subjects one of two nearly identical learning tasks, a task that required learning a rule or one that required using a holistic information-integration strategy.

We propose that when examining the role of stress or pressure in cognitive performance it is important to consider the type of pressure, the stress response, and the aspect of cognition assessed. In Experiment 1, outcome pressure was not experienced as stressful but did lead to impaired performance on a rule-based (RB) category learning task and not a more procedural information-integration (II) task. In Experiment 2, the addition of monitoring pressure resulted in a modest stress response to combined pressure and impairment on both tasks. Across experiments, higher stress appraisals were associated with decreased performance on the RB, but not the II, task. In turn, higher stress-reactivity (heart rate) was associated with enhanced performance on the II, but not the RB, task. This work represents an initial step towards integrating the stress-cognition and pressure-cognition literatures and suggests that integrating these fields may require consideration of the type of pressure, the stress-response, and the cognitive system mediating performance.},

Differential effects on positive and negative feedback especially have received little attention. The objective of this study, thus, was to investigate effects of psychosocial stress on feedback-based learning with a particular focus on the use of negative and positive feedback during learning. Participants completed a probabilistic selection task in both a stress and a control condition. The task allowed quantification of how much participants relied on positive and negative feedback during learning. Although stress had no effect on general acquisition of the task, results indicate that participants used negative feedback significantly less during learning after stress compared with the control condition. An enhancing effect of stress on use of positive feedback failed to reach significance. These findings suggest that stress acts differentially on the use of positive and negative feedback during learning.},

Accumulating evidence indicates that stress may modulate the engagement of multiple memory systems. In particular, rodent and human studies demonstrate that stress facilitates dorsal striatum-dependent “habit” memory, at the expense of hippocampusdependent “cognitive” memory. Based on these data, a model is proposed which states that the impact of stress on the relative use of multiple memory systems is due to (i) differential effects of hormones and neurotransmitters that are released during stressful events on hippocampal and dorsal striatal memory systems, thus changing the relative strength of and the interactions between these systems, and (ii) a modulatory inﬂuence of the amygdala which biases learning toward dorsal striatum-based memory after stress. This shift to habit memory after stress can be adaptive with respect to current performance but might contribute to psychopathology in vulnerable individuals. VC 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In Experiment 1, participants learned categories under unspeeded or speeded conditions. In Experiment 2, they applied previously trained category knowledge under unspeeded or speeded conditions. Speeded conditions selectively impaired implicit category learning and implicit mature categorization. These results illuminate the processing dynamics of explicit/implicit categorization.},

	abstract = {Learning by explicit instruction is a highly eﬃcient way to instantaneously learn new behaviors and to overcome potentially harmful learning by trial-and-error. Despite the importance of instructed learning for education, inﬂuences on the eﬃcacy of an instruction are currently unknown. Decades of research, however, showed that stress is a powerful modulator of learning and memory, including the acquisition of stimulus-response (S-R) associations. Moreover, brain areas critical for instructed learning are a major target of hormones and neurotransmitters released during stress. Thus, we investigated here whether acute stress aﬀects instructed S-R learning and whether this eﬀect diﬀers for trial-and-error learning. To this end, healthy participants underwent a stressor (Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test) or a control manipulation before learning arbitrary S-R associations. For half of the stimuli, participants were explicitly instructed about the correct association, whereas the remaining associations had to be learned by trial-and-error. As expected, the instruction resulted in better performance and enhanced explicit rule knowledge compared to trial-and-error learning. Stress further boosted the beneﬁcial eﬀect of an explicit instruction on learning performance, while leaving trial-and-error learning unchanged. These beneﬁcial eﬀects of stress were directly correlated with the activity of the autonomic nervous system and the concentration of cortisol. Moreover, acute stress could override the detrimental eﬀect of high trait anxiety levels on instructed S-R learning performance. Our ﬁndings indicate that acute stress may facilitate learning from instruction, which may represent a highly eﬃcient way to learn how to act, without the necessity of own experience, that helps to save cognitive resources during a stressful encounter.},

We predicted that small feedback delays of several hundred milliseconds would lead to the best information–integration learning based on a highly regarded neurobiological model of learning in the striatum. In Experiment 1 information–integration learning was best with feedback delays of 500 ms compared to delays of 0 and 1000 ms. This effect was only obtained if the stimulus offset following the response. Rule-based learning was unaffected by the length of feedback delay, but was better when the stimulus was present throughout feedback than when it offset following the response. In Experiment 2 we found that a large variance (SD = 150 ms) in feedback delay times around a mean delay of 500 ms attenuated information–integration learning, but a small variance (SD = 75 ms) did not. In Experiment 3 we found that the delay between stimulus offset and feedback is more critical to information–integration learning than the delay between the response and feedback. These results demonstrate the importance of feedback timing in category-learning situations where a declarative, verbalizable rule cannot easily be used as a heuristic to classify members into their correct category.},

Pressure caused performance decrements for experienced classifiers performing both rule-based and information-integration tasks relative to the control groups. These results contrast with previous research where inexperienced classifiers choked on rule-based tasks but excelled on information-integration tasks.

	abstract = {Behavioral, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging evidence has suggested that categories can often be learned via either an explicit rule-based (RB) mechanism critically dependent on medial temporal and prefrontal brain regions, or via an implicit informationintegration (II) mechanism relying on the basal ganglia. In this study, participants viewed sine-wave gratings (Gabor patches) that varied on two dimensions and learned to categorize them via trial-by-trial feedback. Two different stimulus distributions were used; one was intended to encourage an explicit RB process and the other an implicit II process. We monitored brain activity with scalp electroencephalography (EEG) while each participant: (1) passively observed stimuli represented of both distributions; (2) categorized stimuli from one distribution, and, 1 week later; (3) categorized stimuli from the other distribution. Categorization accuracy was similar for the two distributions. Subtractions of Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) for correct and incorrect trials were used to identify neural differences in RB and II categorization processes. We identiﬁed an occipital brain potential that was differentially modulated by categorization condition accuracy at an early latency (150–250 ms), likely reﬂecting the degree of holistic processing. A stimulus-locked Late Positive Complex (LPC) associated with explicit memory updating was modulated by accuracy in the RB, but not the II task. Likewise, a feedback-locked P300 ERP associated with expectancy was correlated with performance only in the RB, but not the II condition.

Our starting point is the idea that associative learning is best thought of as an effect (i.e., the impact of paired events on behavior) rather than a specific mental process (e.g., the formation of associations). This idea allows us to consider (a) propositional theories according to which associative learning is mediated by higher order mental processes akin to problem solving and (b) relational frame theory that allows one to think of seemingly simple associative learning effects as instances of a complex phenomenon known as arbitrarily applicable relational responding. Based on these 2 theories, we argue that (a) higher order cognition and associative learning are not necessarily mutually exclusive and (b) a more sophisticated conceptualization of higher order cognition is warranted.},

Because the mere statistical contingency between events often does not provide enough information to infer the nature of the relation between those events (e.g., whether one event is a cause or an effect of the other event), it is likely that people will take into account relational information that is provided by the context when forming propositions about the relation between events. Hence, propositional models predict that contextual cues which provide relational information can moderate associative learning.

The name of the framework is abbreviated the MDML, and the conceptual and empirical context from which it emerged is presented. The framework currently consists of four dimensions, (i) coherence, (ii) complexity, (iii) derivation, and (iv) ﬂexibility; and ﬁve levels of relational development, (i) mutual entailing, (ii) relational framing, (iii) relational networking, (iv) relating relations, and (v) relating relational networks. Within the MDML, each of the dimensions intersects with each of the levels, yielding 20 potential units of behavioral analysis, deﬁned as functional-analytic abstractive relational quanta (abbreviated as FAARQs). Some of the conceptual and empirical implications of the MDML are considered, focusing in particular on how it highlights the dynamic properties of AARRing. Speciﬁc examples of how the MDML is (and may) impact upon research in relational frame theory are also presented.},

Both experiments also showed an overall peak-shifted gradient after differential conditioning, but not after single cue conditioning. Importantly, the peak shift could be decomposed into linear and peaked gradients when participants were divided into rule subgroups. Our results highlight the need to consider individual differences in the rules that participants derive in human generalization studies and suggest that in some situations, peak shift may be a consequence of averaging across diverse rule subgroups.},

A growing theory in computational neuroscience is that perception can be successfully described using Bayesian inference models and that the brain is “Bayes-optimal” under some constraints. In this context, expectations are particularly interesting, because they can be viewed as prior beliefs in the statistical inference process. A number of questions remain unsolved, however, for example: How fast do priors change over time? Are there limits in the complexity of the priors that can be learned? How do an individual’s priors compare to the true scene statistics? Can we unlearn priors that are thought to correspond to natural scene statistics? Where and what are the neural substrate of priors? Focusing on the perception of visual motion, we here review recent studies from our laboratories and others addressing these issues. We discuss how these data on motion perception ﬁt within the broader literature on perceptual Bayesian priors, perceptual expectations, and statistical and perceptual learning and review the possible neural basis of priors.},

In this paper, we propose a modular approach to such motor learning and control. We review the behavioral evidence and beneﬁts of modularity, and propose a new architecture based on multiple pairs of inverse (controller) and forward (predictor) models. Within each pair, the inverse and forward models are tightly coupled both during their acquisition, through motor learning, and use, during which the forward models determine the contribution of each inverse model’s output to the ﬁnal motor command. This architecture can simultaneously learn the multiple inverse models necessary for control as well as how to select the inverse models appropriate for a given environment. Finally, we describe speciﬁc predictions of the model, which can be tested experimentally. ᭧ 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The cerebellum is essential for the control of multijoint movements; when the cerebellum is lesioned, the performance error is more than the summed errors produced by single joints. In the companion paper (Schweighofer et al., 1998), a functional anatomical model for visually guided arm movement was proposed. The model comprised a basic feedforward/feedback controller with realistic transmission delays and was connected to a two-link, six-muscle, planar arm. In the present study, we examined the role of the cerebellum in reaching movements by embedding a novel, detailed cerebellar neural network in this functional control model. We could derive realistic cerebellar inputs and the role of the cerebellum in learning to control the arm was assessed. This cerebellar network learned the part of the inverse dynamics of the arm not provided by the basic feedforward/feedback controller. Despite realistically low inferior olive ﬁring rates and noisy mossy ﬁbre inputs, the model could reduce the error between intended and planned movements. The responses of the different cell groups were comparable to those of biological cell groups. In particular, the modelled Purkinje cells exhibited directional tuning after learning and the parallel ﬁbres, due to their length, provide Purkinje cells with the input required for this coordination task. The inferior olive responses contained two different components; the earlier response, locked to movement onset, was always present and the later response disappeared after learning. These results support the theory that the cerebellum is involved in motor learning.},

Currently, two classes of models have been proposed for the neural control of movements, namely the virtual trajectory control hypothesis and the acquisition of internal models of the motor apparatus hypothesis. In the present study, we expand the virtual trajectory model to whole arm reaching movements. This expanded model accurately reproduced slow movements, but faster reaching movements deviated signiﬁcantly from the planned trajectories, indicating that for fast movements, this model was not sufﬁcient. These results led us to propose a new distributed functional model consistent with behavioural, anatomical and neurophysiological data, which takes into account arm muscles, spinal cord, motor cortex and cerebellum and is consistent with the view that the central nervous system acquires a distributed inverse dynamics model of the arm. Previous studies indicated that the cerebellum compensates for the interaction forces that arise during reaching movements. We show here how the cerebellum may increase the accuracy of reaching movements by compensating for the interaction torques by learning a portion of an inverse dynamics model that reﬁnes a basic inverse model in the motor cortex and spinal cord.},

	abstract = {Background:  CADe and CADx systems for the detection and diagnosis of lung cancer have been important areas of research in recent decades. However, these areas are being worked on separately. CADe systems do not present the radiological characteristics of tumors, and CADx systems do not detect nodules and do not have good levels of automation. As a result, these systems are not yet widely used in clinical settings.
Methods:  The purpose of this article is to develop a new system for detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules on CT images, grouping them into a single system for the identification and characterization of the nodules to improve the level of automation. The article also presents as contributions: the use of Watershed and Histogram of oriented Gradients (HOG) techniques for distinguishing the possible nodules from other structures and feature extraction for pulmonary nodules, respectively. For the diagnosis, it is based on the likelihood of malignancy allowing more aid in the decision making by the radiologists. A rule-based classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been used to eliminate false positives.
Results:  The database used in this research consisted of 420 cases obtained randomly from LIDC-IDRI. The segmentation method achieved an accuracy of 97 \% and the detection system showed a sensitivity of 94.4 \% with 7.04 false positives per case. Different types of nodules (isolated, juxtapleural, juxtavascular and ground-glass) with diameters between 3 mm and 30 mm have been detected. For the diagnosis of malignancy our system presented ROC curves with areas of: 0.91 for nodules highly unlikely of being malignant, 0.80 for nodules moderately unlikely of being malignant, 0.72 for nodules with indeterminate malignancy, 0.67 for nodules moderately suspicious of being malignant and 0.83 for nodules highly suspicious of being malignant.
Conclusions:  From our preliminary results, we believe that our system is promising for clinical applications assisting radiologists in the detection and diagnosis of lung cancer.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To identify a new clinical marker based on quantitative kinetic image features analysis and assess its feasibility to predict tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Methods: The authors assembled a dataset involving breast MR images acquired from 68 cancer patients before undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Among them, 25 patients had complete response (CR) and 43 had partial and nonresponse (NR) to chemotherapy based on the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors. The authors developed a computer-aided detection scheme to segment breast areas and tumors depicted on the breast MR images and computed a total of 39 kinetic image features from both tumor and background parenchymal enhancement regions. The authors then applied and tested two approaches to classify between CR and NR cases. The first one analyzed each individual feature and applied a simple feature fusion method that combines classification results from multiple features. The second approach tested an attribute selected classifier that integrates an artificial neural network (ANN) with a wrapper subset evaluator, which was optimized using a leave-one-case-out validation method.
Results: In the pool of 39 features, 10 yielded relatively higher classification performance with the areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) ranging from 0.61 to 0.78 to classify between CR and NR cases. Using a feature fusion method, the maximum AUC = 0.85 ± 0.05. Using the ANN-based classifier, AUC value significantly increased to 0.96 ± 0.03 (p {\textless} 0.01).
Conclusions: This study demonstrated that quantitative analysis of kinetic image features computed from breast MR images acquired prechemotherapy has potential to generate a useful clinical marker in predicting tumor response to chemotherapy.

	abstract = {The striatal medium spiny neuron (MSNs) network is sparsely connected with fairly weak GABAergic collaterals receiving an excitatory glutamatergic cortical projection. Peri stimulus time histograms (PSTH) of MSN population response investigated in various experimental studies display strong firing rate modulations distributed throughout behavioural task epochs. In previous work we have shown by numerical simulation that sparse random networks of inhibitory spiking neurons with characteristics appropriate for UP state MSNs form cell assemblies which fire together coherently in sequences on long behaviourally relevant timescales when the network receives a fixed pattern of constant input excitation. Here we first extend that model to the case where cortical excitation is composed of many independent noisy Poisson processes and demonstrate that cell assembly dynamics is still observed when the input is sufficiently weak. However if cortical excitation strength is increased more regularly firing and completely quiescent cells are found, which depend on the cortical stimulation. Subsequently we further extend previous work to consider what happens when the excitatory input varies as it would in when the animal is engaged in behavior. We investigate how sudden switches in excitation interact with network generated patterned activity. We show that sequences of cell assembly activations can be locked to the excitatory input sequence and delineate the range of parameters where this behaviour is shown. Model cell population PSTH display both stimulus and temporal specificity, with large population firing rate modulations locked to elapsed time from task events. Thus the random network can generate a large diversity of temporally evolving stimulus dependent responses even though the input is fixed between switches. We suggest the MSN network is well suited to the generation of such slow coherent task dependent response},

Cholinergic neurotransmission modulates memory processes in the striatum and other brain structures. This work asks if the activity of striatal microcircuits observed in living nervous tissue, with attributes similar to cell assemblies, exhibit some of the properties proposed to be necessary to compose memory traces. Accordingly, we used whole cell and calcium-imaging techniques to investigate the cholinergic modulation of striatal neuron pools that have been reported to exhibit several properties expected from cell assemblies such as synchronous states of activity and the alternation of this activity among different neuron pools. We analyzed the cholinergic modulation of the activity of neuron pools with multidimensional reduction techniques and vectorization of network dynamics. It was found that the activation of the cholinergic system enables striatal cell assemblies with properties that have been posited for recurrent neural artificial networks with memory storage capabilities. Graph theory techniques applied to striatal network states revealed sequences of vectors with a recursive dynamics similar to closed reverberating cycles. The cycles exhibited a modular architecture and a hierarchical organization. It is then concluded that, under certain conditions, the cholinergic system enables the striatal microcircuit with the ability to compose complex sequences of activity. Neuronal recurrent networks with the characteristics encountered in the present experiments are proposed to allow repeated sequences of activity to become memories and repeated memories to compose learned motor procedures.},

	abstract = {Correlated activity in cortico-basal ganglia circuits plays a key role in the encoding of movement, associative learning and procedural memory. How correlated activity is assembled by striatal microcircuits is not understood. Calcium imaging of striatal neuronal populations, with single-cell resolution, reveals sporadic and asynchronous activity under control conditions. However, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) application induces bistability and correlated activity in striatal neurons. Widespread neurons within the field of observation present burst firing. Sets of neurons exhibit episodes of recurrent and synchronized bursting. Dimensionality reduction of network dynamics reveals functional states defined by cell assemblies that alternate their activity and display spatiotemporal pattern generation. Recurrent synchronous activity travels from one cell assembly to the other often returning to the original assembly; suggesting a robust structure. An initial search into the factors that sustain correlated activity of neuronal assemblies showed a critical dependence on both intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms: blockage of fast glutamatergic transmission annihilates all correlated firing, whereas blockage of GABAergic transmission locked the network into a single dominant state that eliminates assembly diversity. Reduction of L-type Ca(2+)-current restrains synchronization. Each cell assembly comprised different cells, but a small set of neurons was shared by different assemblies. A great proportion of the shared neurons was local interneurons with pacemaking properties. The network dynamics set into action by NMDA in the striatal network may reveal important properties of striatal microcircuits under normal and pathological conditions.},

	abstract = {The striatum, principal input structure of the basal ganglia, is crucial to both motor control and learning. It receives convergent input from all over neocortex, hippocampal formation, amygdala and thalamus, and is the primary recipient of dopamine in the brain. Within the striatum is a GABAergic microcircuit that acts upon these inputs, formed by the dominant medium-spiny projection neurons (MSNs) and fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs). There has been little progress in understanding the computations it performs, hampered by the non-laminar structure that prevents identiﬁcation of a repeating canonical microcircuit. We here begin the identiﬁcation of potential dynamically-deﬁned computational elements within the striatum. We construct a new three-dimensional model of the striatal microcircuit’s connectivity, and instantiate this with our dopamine-modulated neuron models of the MSNs and FSIs. A new model of gap junctions between the FSIs is introduced and tuned to experimental data. We introduce a novel multiple spiketrain analysis method, and apply this to the outputs of the model to ﬁnd groups of synchronised neurons at multiple time-scales. We ﬁnd that, with realistic in vivo background input, small assemblies of synchronised MSNs spontaneously appear, consistent with experimental observations, and that the number of assemblies and the time-scale of synchronisation is strongly dependent on the simulated concentration of dopamine. We also show that feed-forward inhibition from the FSIs counter-intuitively increases the ﬁring rate of the MSNs. Such small cell assemblies forming spontaneously only in the absence of dopamine may contribute to motor control problems seen in humans and animals following loss of dopamine cells.},

We recorded presumed MSNs and FSIs together with motor cortex and globus pallidus (GP) neurons, in rats performing a simple choice task. MSN activity was widely distributed across the task sequence, especially near reward receipt. By contrast, FSIs showed a coordinated pulse of increased activity as chosen actions were initiated, in conjunction with a sharp decrease in GP activity. Both MSNs and FSIs were direction selective, but neighboring MSNs and FSIs showed opposite selectivity. Our ﬁndings suggest that individual FSIs participate in local striatal information processing, but more global disinhibition of FSIs by GP is important for initiating chosen actions while suppressing unwanted alternatives.},

	abstract = {Decision formation recruits many brain regions, but the procedure they jointly execute is unknown. Here we characterize its essential composition, using as a framework a novel recursive Bayesian algorithm that makes decisions based on spike-trains with the statistics of those in sensory cortex (MT). Using it to simulate the random-dot-motion task, we demonstrate it quantitatively replicates the choice behaviour of monkeys, whilst predicting losses of otherwise usable information from MT. Its architecture maps to the recurrent corticobasal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making. We show that the dynamics of its mapped computations match those of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum during decisions, and forecast those of basal ganglia output and thalamus. This also predicts which aspects of neural dynamics are and are not part of inference. Our single-equation algorithm is probabilistic, distributed, recursive, and parallel. Its success at capturing anatomy, behaviour, and electrophysiology suggests that the mechanism implemented by the brain has these same characteristics.

	abstract = {The basal ganglia are considered vital to action selection - a hypothesis supported by several biologically plausible computational models. Of the several subnuclei of the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus externa (GPe) has been thought of largely as a relay nucleus, and its intrinsic connectivity has not been incorporated in significant detail, in any model thus far. Here, we incorporate newly revealed subgroups of neurons within the GPe into an existing computational model of the basal ganglia, and investigate their role in action selection. Three main results ensued. First, using previously used metrics for selection, the new extended connectivity improved the action selection performance of the model. Second, low frequency theta oscillations were observed in the subpopulation of the GPe (the TA or ‘arkypallidal’ neurons) which project exclusively to the striatum. These oscillations were suppressed by increased dopamine activity — revealing a possible link with symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Third, a new phenomenon was observed in which the usual monotonic relationship between input to the basal ganglia and its output within an action ‘channel’ was, under some circumstances, reversed. Thus, at high levels of input, further increase of this input to the channel could cause an increase of the corresponding output rather than the more usually observed decrease. Moreover, this phenomenon was associated with the prevention of multiple channel selection, thereby assisting in optimal action selection. Examination of the mechanistic origin of our results showed the so-called ‘prototypical’ GPe neurons to be the principal subpopulation influencing action selection. They control the striatum via the arkypallidal neurons and are also able to regulate the output nuclei directly. Taken together, our results highlight the role of the GPe as a major control hub of the basal ganglia, and provide a mechanistic account for its control function.},

	abstract = {Habit formation is a behavioral adaptation that automates routine actions. Habitual behavior correlates with broad reconfigurations of dorsolateral striatal (DLS) circuit properties that increase gain and shift pathway timing. The mechanism(s) for these circuit adaptations are unknown and could be responsible for habitual behavior. Here we find that a single class of interneuron, fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs), modulates all of these habit-predictive properties. Consistent with a role in habits, FSIs are more excitable in habitual mice compared to goal-directed and acute chemogenetic inhibition of FSIs in DLS prevents the expression of habitual lever pressing. In vivo recordings further reveal a previously unappreciated selective modulation of SPNs based on their firing patterns; FSIs inhibit most SPNs but paradoxically promote the activity of a subset displaying high fractions of gamma-frequency spiking. These results establish a microcircuit mechanism for habits and provide a new example of how interneurons mediate experience-dependent behavior.
          , 
            From biting fingernails to the daily commute, habits are sets of actions that can be completed almost without thinking and that are difficult to change or stop. Behavioral neuroscientists refer to habits as “stimulus-response” behaviors, and know that forming a new habit requires a region deep within the brain called the dorsolateral striatum. Indeed, in this region, the outgoing neurons – which make up 95\% of the cells - respond differently to incoming signals in mice that have learned habits compared to non-habitual mice. However a question remained: what exactly was producing these differences?
            O’Hare et al. have now found, unexpectedly, that the answer resides not in the 95\% of outgoing neurons, but rather in a rare type of cell known as the fast-spiking interneuron. This cell is connected to many others and it appears to act like a conductor, orchestrating the previously identified changes in the output neurons. These findings were made using mice that had been trained to press a lever for a sugar pellet reward. Habit was measured by how long mice kept pressing even if they had just been allowed to eat their fill of pellets and the test lever was no longer dispensing pellets. Habitual mice continue to press the lever in this circumstance, while other mice do not.
            O’Hare et al. found that inactivating the “conductor” cell made the output neurons respond in the opposite way to how they normally respond in habitual mice. Further experiments showed that fast-spiking interneurons were also more easily activated in habitual mice. To test whether this putative “conductor” cell was necessary for habitual behaviors, a technique known as chemogenetics was used to turn down its activity in habitual mice. Indeed, reducing activity in the conductor cell blocked the habitual behavior.
            While some habits are a helpful and economical way to get through daily life, habits are also thought to be corrupted in a number of diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, addictions and compulsions. Identifying this specific, yet rare, cell as a critical part of maintaining habits points out a new target to consider for therapies. Further work is needed before such treatments might become available to treat habit-related disorders; though O'Hare et al. are now taking steps in this direction by trying to work out how the fast-spiking interneuron changes its own activity when a habit is formed.},

	abstract = {During sensorimotor tasks, subjects use sensory feedback but also prior information. It is often assumed that the sensorimotor prior is just given by the experiment and that the details for acquiring this prior (e.g., the effector) are irrelevant. However, recent research has suggested that the construction of priors is nontrivial. To test if the sensorimotor details matter for the construction of a prior, we designed two tasks that differ only in the effectors that subjects use to indicate their estimate. For both a typical reaching setting and an atypical wrist rotation setting, prior and feedback uncertainty matter as quantitatively predicted by Bayesian statistics. However, in violation of simple Bayesian models, the importance of the prior differs across effectors. Subjects overly rely on their prior in the typical reaching case compared with the wrist case. The brain is not naively Bayesian with a single and veridical prior.
            NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Traditional Bayesian models often assume that we learn statistics of movements and use the information as a prior to guide subsequent movements. The effector is merely a reporting modality for information processing. We asked subjects to perform a visuomotor learning task with different effectors (finger or wrist). Surprisingly, we found that prior information is used differently between the effectors, suggesting that learning of the prior is related to the movement context such as the effector involved or that naive models of Bayesian behavior need to be extended.},

We wanted to clarify what the distribution of opinions actually is, what probability the best experts currently assign to high–level machine intelligence coming up within a particular time–frame, which risks they see with that development, and how fast they see these developing. We thus designed a brief questionnaire and distributed it to four groups of experts in 2012/2013. The median estimate of respondents was for a one in two chance that highlevel machine intelligence will be developed around 2040-2050, rising to a nine in ten chance by 2075. Experts expect that systems will move on to superintelligence in less than 30 years thereafter. They estimate the chance is about one in three that this development turns out to be ‘bad’ or ‘extremely bad’ for humanity.},

Participants have enormous difficulty in this task. Despite intensive and ongoing category training, they detect targets at near-chance levels unless displays are extremely simple or target categories extremely focused. These results, discussed from the perspectives of categorization and visual search, might illuminate societally important instances of visual search (e.g., diagnostic medical screening).},

	abstract = {The role of dopamine in behaviour and decision-making is often cast in terms of reinforcement learning and optimal decision theory. Here, we present an alternative view that frames the physiology of dopamine in terms of Bayes-optimal behaviour. In this account, dopamine controls the precision or salience of (external or internal) cues that engender action. In other words, dopamine balances bottom-up sensory information and top-down prior beliefs when making hierarchical inferences (predictions) about cues that have affordance. In this paper, we focus on the consequences of changing tonic levels of dopamine firing using simulations of cued sequential movements. Crucially, the predictions driving movements are based upon a hierarchical generative model that infers the context in which movements are made. This means that we can confuse agents by changing the context (order) in which cues are presented. These simulations provide a (Bayes-optimal) model of contextual uncertainty and set switching that can be quantified in terms of behavioural and electrophysiological responses. Furthermore, one can simulate dopaminergic lesions (by changing the precision of prediction errors) to produce pathological behaviours that are reminiscent of those seen in neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. We use these simulations to demonstrate how a single functional role for dopamine at the synaptic level can manifest in different ways at the behavioural level.},

	abstract = {Dopamine plays a key role in learning; however, its exact function in decision making and choice remains unclear. Recently, we proposed a generic model based on active (Bayesian) inference wherein dopamine encodes the precision of beliefs about optimal policies. Put simply, dopamine discharges reflect the confidence that a chosen policy will lead to desired outcomes. We designed a novel task to test this hypothesis, where subjects played a “limited offer” game in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment. Subjects had to decide how long to wait for a high offer before accepting a low offer, with the risk of losing everything if they waited too long. Bayesian model comparison showed that behavior strongly supported active inference, based on surprise minimization, over classical utility maximization schemes. Furthermore, midbrain activity, encompassing dopamine projection neurons, was accurately predicted by trial-by-trial variations in model-based estimates of precision. Our findings demonstrate that human subjects infer both optimal policies and the precision of those inferences, and thus support the notion that humans perform hierarchical probabilistic Bayesian inference. In other words, subjects have to infer both what they should do as well as how confident they are in their choices, where confidence may be encoded by dopaminergic firing.},

This is supported by studies where optogenetic stimulation of dopamine neurons can stand in lieu of actual reward. Nevertheless, a large body of data also shows that dopamine is not necessary for learning, and that dopamine depletion primarily affects task performance. We offer a resolution to this paradox based on an hypothesis that dopamine encodes the precision of beliefs about alternative actions, and thus controls the outcome-sensitivity of behavior. We extend an active inference scheme for solving Markov decision processes to include learning, and show that simulated dopamine dynamics strongly resemble those actually observed during instrumental conditioning. Furthermore, simulated dopamine depletion impairs performance but spares learning, while simulated excitation of dopamine neurons drives reward learning, through aberrant inference about outcome states. Our formal approach provides a novel and parsimonious reconciliation of apparently divergent experimental ﬁndings.},

Although the dictum is a widely held and well-motivated principle in decoding research, it has received scant philosophical attention. We critically evaluate the dictum, arguing that it is false: decodability is a poor guide for revealing the content of neural representations.

Future progress in understanding brain function using these methods will require addressing a number of key methodological and interpretive challenges. Because these challenges often remain unseen and metaphorically “haunt” our efforts to use these methods to understand the brain, we refer to them as “ghosts”. In this paper, we describe three such ghosts, situate them within a more general framework from philosophy of science, and then describe steps to address them. The ﬁrst ghost arises from difﬁculties in determining what information machine learning classiﬁers use for decoding. The second ghost arises from the interplay of experimental design and the structure of information in the brain – that is, our methods embody implicit assumptions about information processing in the brain, and it is often difﬁcult to determine if those assumptions are satisﬁed. The third ghost emerges from our limited ability to distinguish information that is merely decodable from the brain from information that is represented and used by the brain. Each of the three ghosts place limits on the interpretability of decoding research in cognitive neuroscience. There are no easy solutions, but facing these issues squarely will provide a clearer path to understanding the nature of representation and computation in the human brain.},

	abstract = {Motor learning encompasses a wide range of phenomena, ranging from relatively low-level mechanisms for maintaining calibration of our movements, to making high-level cognitive decisions about how to act in a novel situation. We survey the major existing approaches to characterizing motor learning at both the behavioral and neural level. In particular, we critically review two long-standing paradigms used in motor learning research—adaptation and sequence learning. We discuss the extent to which these paradigms can be considered models of motor skill acquisition, deﬁned as the incremental improvement in our ability to rapidly select and then precisely execute appropriate actions, and conclude that they fall short of doing so. We then discuss two classes of emerging research paradigms—learning of arbitrary visuomotor mappings de novo and learning to execute movements with improved acuity—that more effectively address the acquisition of motor skill. Future work will be needed to determine the degree to which laboratory-based studies of skill, as described in this review, will relate to true expertise, which is likely dependent on the effects of practice on multiple cognitive processes that go beyond traditional sensorimotor neural architecture. © 2019 American Physiological Society.

This is clearly seen in drug rehabilitation clinics where patients often relapse soon after leaving the context of the treatment facility. A similar pattern is commonly observed in controlled laboratory studies of context-dependent savings in instrumental conditioning, where simply placing an animal back into the original conditioning chamber can renew an extinguished instrumental response. Surprisingly, context-dependent savings in human procedural learning has not been carefully examined in the laboratory. Here, we provide the ﬁrst known empirical demonstration of contextdependent savings in a perceptual categorization task known to recruit procedural learning. We also present a computational account of these savings using a biologically detailed model in which a key role is played by cholinergic interneurons in the striatum.},

	abstract = {Huge amounts of money are spent every year on unlearning programs—in drug-treatment facilities, prisons, psychotherapy clinics, and schools. Yet almost all of these programs fail, since recidivism rates are high in each of these fields. Progress on this problem requires a better understanding of the mechanisms that make unlearning so difficult. Much cognitive neuroscience evidence suggests that an important component of these mechanisms also dictates success on categorization tasks that recruit procedural learning and depend on synaptic plasticity within the striatum. A biologically detailed computational model of this striatal-dependent learning is described (based on Ashby \& Crossley, 2011). The model assumes that a key component of striatal-dependent learning is provided by interneurons in the striatum called the tonically active neurons (TANs), which act as a gate for the learning and expression of striatal-dependent behaviors. In their tonically active state, the TANs prevent the expression of any striatal-dependent behavior. However, they learn to pause in rewarding environments and thereby permit the learning and expression of striatal-dependent behaviors. The model predicts that when rewards are no longer contingent on behavior, the TANs cease to pause, which protects striatal learning from decay and prevents unlearning. In addition, the model predicts that when rewards are partially contingent on behavior, the TANs remain partially paused, leaving the striatum available for unlearning. The results from 3 human behavioral studies support the model predictions and suggest a novel unlearning protocol that shows promising initial signs of success.},

The current paper quantitatively describes the properties of the model using analysis and simulation. The decomposition of the basal ganglia into selection and control pathways is supported in several ways. First, several elegant features are exposed ± capacity scaling, enhanced selectivity and synergistic dopamine modulation ± which might be expected to exist in a well designed action selection mechanism. The discovery of these features also lends support to the computational premise of selection that underpins our model. Second, good matches between model globus pallidus external segment output and globus pallidus internal segment and substantia nigra reticulata area output, and neurophysiological data, have been found which are indicative of common architectural features in the model and biological basal ganglia. Third, the behaviour of the model as a signal selection mechanism has parallels with some kinds of action selection observed in animals under various levels of dopaminergic modulation.},

The generic properties of signal selection are de®ned and neural networks for this type of computation examined. A comparison between these networks and basal ganglia anatomy leads to a novel functional decomposition of the basal ganglia architecture into `selection' and `control' pathways. The former pathway performs the selection per se via a feedforward o-centre on-surround network. The control pathway regulates the action of the selection pathway to ensure its eective operation, and synergistically complements its dopaminergic modulation.

	abstract = {The nature of the relationship between spatial attention and eye movements has been the subject of intense debate for more than 40 years. Two ideas have dominated this debate. First is the idea that spatial attention shares common neural mechanisms with eye movement programming, characterizing attention as an eye movement that has been prepared but not executed. Second, based on the observation that attention shifts to saccade targets, several theories have proposed that saccade programming necessarily recruits attentional resources. In this chapter, we review the evidence for each of these ideas and discuss some of the limitations and challenges in conﬁrming their predictions. Although they are clearly dependent under some circumstances, dissociations between spatial attention and eye movements, and clear differences in their basic functions, point to the existence of two interconnected, but separate, systems.},

	abstract = {Sensorimotor control requires an accurate estimate of the state of the body. The brain optimizes state estimation by combining sensory signals with predictions of the sensory consequences of motor commands using a forward model. Given that both sensory signals and predictions are uncertain (i.e., noisy), the brain optimally weights the relative reliance on each source of information during adaptation. In support, it is known that uncertainty in the sensory predictions influences the rate and generalization of visuomotor adaptation. We investigated whether uncertainty in the sensory predictions affects the retention of a new visuomotor relationship. This was done by exposing three separate groups to a visuomotor rotation whose mean was common at 15° counterclockwise but whose variance around the mean differed (i.e., SD of 0°, 3.2°, or 4.5°). Retention was assessed by measuring the persistence of the adapted behavior in a no-vision phase. Results revealed that mean reach direction late in adaptation was similar across groups, suggesting it depended mainly on the mean of exposed rotations and was robust to differences in variance. However, retention differed across groups, with higher levels of variance being associated with a more rapid reversion toward nonadapted behavior. A control experiment ruled out the possibility that differences in retention were accounted for by differences in success rates. Exposure to variable rotations may have increased the uncertainty in sensory predictions, making the adapted forward model more labile and susceptible to change or decay.
            NEW \& NOTEWORTHY The brain predicts the sensory consequences of motor commands through a forward model. These predictions are subject to uncertainty. We use visuomotor adaptation and modulate uncertainty in the sensory predictions by manipulating the variance in exposed rotations. Results reveal that variance does not influence the final extent of adaptation but selectively impairs the retention of motor memories. These results suggest that a more uncertain forward model is more susceptible to change or decay.},

	abstract = {Humans can operate a variety of modern tools, which are often associated with different visuomotor transformations. Studies investigating this ability have repeatedly found that the simultaneous acquisition of different transformations appears inextricably tied to distinct states associated with movement, such as different postures or action plans, whereas abstract contextual associations can be leveraged by explicit aiming strategies. It still remains unclear how different transformations are remembered implicitly when target postures are similar. We investigated if features of planning to manipulate a visual tool, such as its visual identity or the intended effect enable implicit learning of opposing visuomotor rotations. Both cues only affected implicit aftereffects indirectly through generalization around explicit strategies. In contrast, practicing transformations with different hands resulted in separate aftereffects. It appears that different (intended) body states are necessary to separate aftereffects, supporting the idea that underlying implicit adaptation is limited to the recalibration of a body model.},

However, despite the existence of detailed theory describing how the expected reward is learned in the basal ganglia, it is not known how reward uncertainty is estimated in these circuits. This paper presents a class of models that encode both the mean reward and the spread of the rewards, the former in the difference between the synaptic weights of D1 and D2 neurons, and the latter in their sum. In the models, the tendency to seek (or avoid) options with variable reward can be controlled by increasing (or decreasing) the tonic level of dopamine. The models are consistent with the physiology of and synaptic plasticity in the basal ganglia, they explain the effects of dopaminergic manipulations on choices involving risks, and they make multiple experimental predictions.},

Although multiple environments can be learned simultaneously if each environment is experienced with different limb movement kinematics [4–7], it is controversial as to whether multiple internal models for a particular movement can be learned and ﬂexibly retrieved according to behavioral contexts [7–14]. Here, we address this issue by using a novel visuomotor task. While participants reached to each of two targets located at a clockwise or counter-clockwise position, a gradually increasing visual rotation was applied in the clockwise or counter-clockwise direction, respectively, to the onscreen cursor representing the unseen hand position. This procedure implicitly led participants to perform physically identical pointing movements irrespective of their intentions (i.e., movement plans) to move their hand toward two distinct visual targets. Surprisingly, if each identical movement was executed according to a distinct movement plan, participants could readily adapt these movements to two opposing force ﬁelds simultaneously. The results demonstrate that multiple motor memories can be learned and ﬂexibly retrieved, even for physically identical movements, according to distinct motor plans in a visual space.},

	abstract = {In motor tasks, errors between planned and actual movements generally result in adaptive changes which reduce the occurrence of similar errors in the future. It has commonly been assumed that the motor adaptation arising from an error occurring on a particular movement is specifically associated with the motion that was planned. Here we show that this is not the case. Instead, we demonstrate the binding of the adaptation arising from an error on a particular trial to the motion experienced on that same trial. The formation of this association means that future movements planned to resemble the motion experienced on a given trial benefit maximally from the adaptation arising from it. This reflects the idea that actual rather than planned motions are assigned ‘credit’ for motor errors because, in a computational sense, the maximal adaptive response would be associated with the condition credited with the error. We studied this process by examining the patterns of generalization associated with motor adaptation to novel dynamic environments during reaching arm movements in humans. We found that these patterns consistently matched those predicted by adaptation associated with the actual rather than the planned motion, with maximal generalization observed where actual motions were clustered. We followed up these findings by showing that a novel training procedure designed to leverage this newfound understanding of the binding of learning to action, can improve adaptation rates by greater than 50\%. Our results provide a mechanistic framework for understanding the effects of partial assistance and error augmentation during neurologic rehabilitation, and they suggest ways to optimize their use.},

Aftereffects, conceived as a measure of implicit knowledge, were only poorly developed. Furthermore, only participants in the younger group exhibited systematic explicit knowledge of the visuomotor rotations. Subsequent analyses revealed strong correlations between the quality of explicit knowledge and the overall visuomotor adaptation. Thus, visually cued dual adaptation to two opposite visuomotor rotations is primarily mediated by conscious strategic corrections based on explicit knowledge of the transformations, a process, which is selectively impaired in older adults.},

	abstract = {Adapting hand movements to changes in our body or the environment is essential for skilled motor behavior. Although eye movements are known to assist hand movement control, how eye movements might contribute to the adaptation of hand movements remains largely unexplored. To determine to what extent eye movements contribute to visuomotor adaptation of hand tracking, participants were asked to track a visual target that followed an unpredictable trajectory with a cursor using a joystick. During blocks of trials, participants were either allowed to look wherever they liked or required to fixate a cross at the center of the screen. Eye movements were tracked to ensure gaze fixation as well as to examine free gaze behavior. The cursor initially responded normally to the joystick, but after several trials, the direction in which it responded was rotated by 90°. Although fixating the eyes had a detrimental influence on hand tracking performance, participants exhibited a rather similar time course of adaptation to rotated visual feedback in the gaze-fixed and gaze-free conditions. More importantly, there was extensive transfer of adaptation between the gaze-fixed and gaze-free conditions. We conclude that although eye movements are relevant for the online control of hand tracking, they do not play an important role in the visuomotor adaptation of such tracking. These results suggest that participants do not adapt by changing the mapping between eye and hand movements, but rather by changing the mapping between hand movements and the cursor’s motion independently of eye movements.
            NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Eye movements assist hand movements in everyday activities, but their contribution to visuomotor adaptation remains largely unknown. We compared adaptation of hand tracking under free gaze and fixed gaze. Although our results confirm that following the target with the eyes increases the accuracy of hand movements, they unexpectedly demonstrate that gaze fixation does not hinder adaptation. These results suggest that eye movements have distinct contributions for online control and visuomotor adaptation of hand movements.},

Here we show that the speciﬁc motor memory active at any given moment critically depends on the movement that will be made in the near future. We demonstrate that associating a different follow-through movement with two motor skills that normally interfere [3–7 ] allows them to be learned simultaneously, suggesting that distinct future actions activate separate motor memories. This implies that when learning a skill, a variable follow-through would activate multiple motor memories across practice, whereas a consistent follow-through would activate a single motor memory, resulting in faster learning. We conﬁrm this prediction and show that such follow-through effects inﬂuence adaptation over time periods associated with real-world skill learning. Overall, our results indicate that movements made in the immediate future inﬂuence the current active motor memory. This suggests that there is a critical time period both before [8 ] and after the current movement that determines motor memory activation and controls learning.},

Therefore, movements that share an initial trajectory but then diverge might have different neural states during the execution of the identical initial trajectories. We hypothesized that motor adaptation maps neural states to changes in motor command. This predicts that two opposing perturbations, which interfere when experienced over the same movement, could be learned if each is associated with a different plan even if not executed. We show that planning, but not executing, different follow-through movements allow opposing perturbations to be learned simultaneously over the same movement. However, no learning occurs if different follow throughs are executed, but not planned prior to movement initiation. Our results suggest neural, rather than physical states, are the critical factor associated with motor adaptation.},

	abstract = {Generalization is a fundamental aspect of behavior, allowing for the transfer of knowledge from one context to another. The details of this transfer are thought to reveal how the brain represents what it learns. Generalization has been a central focus in studies of sensorimotor adaptation, and its pattern has been well characterized: Learning of new dynamic and kinematic transformations in one region of space tapers off in a Gaussian-like fashion to neighboring untrained regions, echoing tuned population codes in the brain. In contrast to common allusions to generalization in cognitive science, generalization in visually guided reaching is usually framed as a passive consequence of neural tuning functions rather than a cognitive feature of learning. While previous research has presumed that maximum generalization occurs at the instructed task goal or the actual movement direction, recent work suggests that maximum generalization may occur at the location of an explicitly accessible movement plan. Here we provide further support for plan-based generalization, formalize this theory in an updated model of adaptation, and test several unexpected implications of the model. First, we employ a generalization paradigm to parameterize the generalization function and ascertain its maximum point. We then apply the derived generalization function to our model and successfully simulate and fit the time course of implicit adaptation across three behavioral experiments. We find that dynamics predicted by plan-based generalization are borne out in the data, are contrary to what traditional models predict, and lead to surprising implications for the behavioral, computational, and neural characteristics of sensorimotor adaptation.
            NEW \& NOTEWORTHY The pattern of generalization is thought to reveal how the motor system represents learned actions. Recent work has made the intriguing suggestion that maximum generalization in sensorimotor adaptation tasks occurs at the location of the learned movement plan.

But no matter the changes, one of the most important components of neural networks is still the node, which represents the neuron. Within spiking neural networks, the node is especially important because it contains the functions and properties of neurons that are necessary for their network. One important aspect of neurons is the ionic ﬂow which produces action potentials, or spikes. Forces of diffusion and electrostatic pressure work together with the physical properties of the cell to move ions around changing the cell membrane potential which ultimately produces the action potential. This tutorial reviews the Hodkgin-Huxley model and shows how it simulates the ionic ﬂow of the giant squid axon via four differential equations. The model is implemented in Matlab using Euler’s Method to approximate the differential equations. By using Euler’s method, an extra parameter is created, the time step. This new parameter needs to be carefully considered or the results of the node may be impaired.},

The overall goals are to provide an accessible and self-contained tutorial, along with a practical computation tool. We begin with how Bayesian computation is typically described in academic articles. Technical difficulties are addressed by a hypothetical, worked-out example. We show how Bayesian computation can be broken down into a series of simpler calculations, which can then be assembled together to complete a computationally more complex model. The details are described much more explicitly than what is typically available in elementary introductions to Bayesian modeling so that readers are not overwhelmed by the mathematics. Moreover, the provided computer program shows how Bayesian LCA can be implemented with relative ease. The computer program is then applied in a large, real-world data set and explained line-by-line. We outline the general steps in how to extend these considerations to other methodological applications. We conclude with suggestions for further readings.},

	abstract = {Decisions must be implemented through actions, and actions are prone to error. As such, when an expected outcome is not obtained, an individual should be sensitive to not only whether the choice itself was suboptimal but also whether the action required to indicate that choice was executed successfully. The intelligent assignment of credit to action execution versus action selection has clear ecological utility for the learner. To explore this, we used a modiﬁed version of a classic reinforcement learning task in which feedback indicated whether negative prediction errors were, or were not, associated with execution errors. Using fMRI, we asked if prediction error computations in the human striatum, a key substrate in reinforcement learning and decision making, are modulated when a failure in action execution results in the negative outcome. Participants were more tolerant of non-rewarded outcomes when these resulted from execution errors versus when execution was successful, but reward was withheld. Consistent with this behavior, a model-driven analysis of neural activity revealed an attenuation of the signal associated with negative reward prediction errors in the striatum following execution failures. These results converge with other lines of evidence suggesting that prediction errors in the mesostriatal dopamine system integrate high-level information during the evaluation of instantaneous reward outcomes.},

	abstract = {Accurate performance of reaching movements depends on adaptable neural circuitry that learns to predict forces and compensate for limb dynamics. In earlier experiments, we quantified generalization from training at one arm position to another position. The generalization patterns suggested that neural elements learning to predict forces coded a limb's state in an intrinsic, muscle-like coordinate system. Here, we test the sensitivity of these elements to the other arm by quantifying inter-arm generalization. We considered two possible coordinate systems: an intrinsic (joint) representation should generalize with mirror symmetry reflecting the joint's symmetry and an extrinsic representation should preserve the task's structure in extrinsic coordinates. Both coordinate systems of generalization were compared with a naı̈ve control group. We tested transfer in right-handed subjects both from dominant to nondominant arm (D→ND) and vice versa (ND→D). This led to a 2 × 3 experimental design matrix: transfer direction (D→ND/ND→D) by coordinate system (extrinsic, intrinsic, control). Generalization occurred only from dominant to nondominant arm and only in extrinsic coordinates. To assess the dependence of generalization on callosal inter-hemispheric communication, we tested commissurotomy patient JW. JWshowed generalization from dominant to nondominant arm in extrinsic coordinates. The results suggest that when the dominant right arm is used in learning dynamics, the information could be represented in the left hemisphere with neural elements tuned to both the right arm and the left arm. In contrast, learning with the nondominant arm seems to rely on the elements in the nondominant hemisphere tuned only to movements of that arm.},

	abstract = {1. Although reaching movements are characterized by hand paths that tend to follow roughly straight lines in Cartesian space, a fundamental issue is whether this reflects constraints associated with perception or movement production. 2. To address this issue, we examined two-joint planar reaching movements in which we manipulated the mapping between actual and visually perceived motion. In particular, we used a nonlinear transformation such that straight line hand paths in Cartesian space would result in curved paths in perceived space and vice versa. 3. Under these conditions, subjects learned to make straight line paths in perceived space even though the paths of the hand in Cartesian space were markedly curved. In contrast, when the motion was perceived in Cartesian space (i.e., in the absence of a nonlinear distortion), straight line hand paths were observed. 4. These findings suggest that visually guided reaching movements are planned in a perceptual frame of reference. Reaching movements in the horizontal plane are adapted so as to produce straight lines in visually perceived space.},

Each subject participated in two sessions, separated by a pause of 2 min to 1 month duration. We found that adaptation was achieved within minutes, and persisted in the memory for at least a month, with only a small decay (experiment A). When the discordances administered in the two sessions were in mutual conflict, we found evidence for task interference (experiment B). However, when the discordances were independent, we found facilitation rather than interference (experiment C); the latter finding could not be explained by the use of an “easier” discordance in the second session (experiment D). We conclude that interference is due to an incompatibility between task requirements, and not to a competition of tasks for short-term memory. We further conclude that the ability to adapt to a sensorimotor discordance can be improved by practicing with an unrelated discordance.},

	abstract = {Although adaptation to novel motor tasks is sometimes a very slow process, de-adaptation is usually extremely rapid. Such rapid deadaptation is seen in dynamic learning in which subjects can take hundreds of movements to learn a novel force environment but only a few movements to de-adapt back to a normal or “null” force environment. We investigated whether this effect is unique to the null environment or reveals a more general rapid adaptation mechanism by studying how subjects behave when their dynamic environment changes. We observed that after learning a dynamic force ﬁeld, subjects took longer to de-adapt when the forces were turned off than to adapt to a novel scaled-down version of the experienced ﬁeld. This demonstrates that rapid adaptation is not unique to the “null” force environment. Moreover, we examined subjects’ ability to adapt from a learned ﬁeld to either a scaled down ﬁeld or to a ﬁeld in which the sign of the forces changed. Even though in both conditions the required change in force output was identical, subjects were signiﬁcantly faster at adapting to the scaled down ﬁeld. The result suggests that rapid de-adaptation reﬂects a capacity to scale down the relative contribution of existing control modules to the motor output.},

In two experiments, participants learned simple perceptual categories with unequal base-rates (i.e., presentation frequency). In Experiment 1, participants received either response training or observational training. In Experiment 2, participants received response training with either immediate or delayed feedback. In previous studies, observational training and delayed feedback training have been shown to disrupt implicit learning. We found that base-rate influence was weaker in these conditions when category discriminability was low (i.e., when category membership was difficult to determine). This conclusion was based on signal detection β values as well as decision-bound modeling results. Because these disruptions to implicit learning attenuate the base-rate effect, we conclude that implicit learning does indeed underlie the influence of base-rates learned through direct experience. This suggests that the implicit learning system postulated by the COVIS theory of categorization (Ashby, Alfonso-Reese, Turken, \& Waldron Psychological Review, 105, 442-481, 1998) may be involved in developing sensitivity to category base-rates.},

Across 4 experiments, we examined the effects of 2 variables, the delay between response and feedback and the informativeness of feedback, which had previously been shown to dissociate learning of the 2 types of category structure. Our aim was twofold: first, to determine whether these dissociations meet the more stringent inferential criteria of state-trace analysis and, second, to determine the conditions under which they can be observed. Experiment 1 confirmed that a mask-filled feedback delay dissociated the learning of RB and II category structures with minimally informative (yes/no) feedback and also met the state-trace criteria for the involvement of multiple latent variables. Experiment 2 showed that this effect is eliminated when a less similar, fixed pattern mask is presented in the interval between response and feedback. Experiment 3 showed that the selective effect of feedback delay on II learning is reduced with fully informative feedback (in which the correct category is specified after an incorrect response) and that feedback type did not dissociate RB and II learning. Experiment 4 extended the results of Experiment 2, showing that the differential effect of feedback delay is eliminated when a fixed pattern mask is used. These results pose important challenges to models of category learning, and we discuss their implications for multiple learning system models and their alternatives.},

However, the classic signal detection model presumes the a priori existence of fixed stimulus representations— usually Gaussian distributions— even when the observer has no experience with the task. Furthermore, the classic signal detection model requires the observer to place a response criterion along the axis of stimulus strength, and without theoretical elaboration, this criterion is fixed and independent of the observer’s experience. We present a dynamic, adaptive model that addresses these 2 long-standing issues. Our model describes how the stimulus representation can develop from a rough subjective prior and thereby explains changes in signal detection performance over time. The model structure also provides a basis for the signal detection decision that does not require the placement of a criterion along the axis of stimulus strength. We present simulations of the model to examine its behavior and several experiments that provide data to test the model. We also fit the model to recognition memory data and discuss the role that feedback plays in establishing stimulus representations.},

	abstract = {The capacity to anticipate the timing of events in a dynamic environment allows us to optimize the processes necessary for perceiving, attending to, and responding to them. Such anticipation requires neuronal mechanisms that track the passage of time and use this representation, combined with prior experience, to estimate the likelihood that an event will occur (i.e., the event's “hazard rate”). Although hazard-like ramps in activity have been observed in several cortical areas in preparation for movement, it remains unclear how such time-dependent probabilities are estimated to optimize response performance. We studied the spiking activity of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of monkeys during an arm-reaching task for which the foreperiod preceding the “go” signal varied randomly along a uniform distribution. After extended training, the monkeys' reaction times correlated inversely with foreperiod duration, reflecting a progressive anticipation of the go signal according to its hazard rate. Many dopamine neurons modulated their firing rates as predicted by a succession of hazard-related prediction errors. First, as time passed during the foreperiod, slowly decreasing anticipatory activity tracked the elapsed time as if encoding negative prediction errors. Then, when the go signal appeared, a phasic response encoded the temporal unpredictability of the event, consistent with a positive prediction error. Neither the anticipatory nor the phasic signals were affected by the anticipated magnitudes of future reward or effort, or by parameters of the subsequent movement. These results are consistent with the notion that dopamine neurons encode hazard-related prediction errors independently of other information.},

Our main goal was to provide evidence in favor of the hypothesis that amplitude and direction of the movements are planned independently on the basis of the hand-target vector (vectorial parametric hypothesis, VP). The analysis was carried out mainly at the individual level. By screening a number of formal models of the potential error components, we found that only models compatible with the VP hypothesis provide an accurate description of the error pattern. A quantitative analysis showed that errors are explained mostly by a bias in the represented initial hand position (46\% of the sum of squared errors) and a visuomotor gain bias (26\%). Range effect (3\%), directional biases (3\%), and inertia-dependent amplitude modulations (1\%) also provided significant contributions. The error pattern was incompatible with the view that movements are planned by specifying either a final posture or a final position. Instead, the results fully supported the view that, at least in the horizontal plane, amplitude, and direction of pointing movements are planned independently in a hand- or target-centered frame of reference.},

Neurophysiol. 79: 3290–3294, 1998. By comparing the visuomotor performance of 10 adult, normal subjects in three tasks, we investigated whether errors in pointing movements reflect biased estimations of the hand starting position. In a manual pointing task with no visual feedback, subjects aimed at 48 targets spaced regularly around two starting positions. Nine subjects exhibited a similar pattern of systematic errors across targets, i.e., a parallel shift of the end points that accounted, on average, for 49\% of the total variability. The direction of the shift depended on the starting location. Systematic errors decreased dramatically in the second condition where subjects were allowed to see their hand before movement onset. The third task was to use a joystick held by the left hand to estimate the location of their (unseen) right hand. The systematic perceptual errors in this condition were found to be highly correlated with the motor errors in the first condition. The results support the following conclusions. 1) Kinesthetic estimation of hand position may be consistently biased. Some of the mechanisms responsible for these biases are always active, irrespective of whether position is estimated overtly (e.g., with a matching paradigm), or covertly as part of the motor planning for aimed movements. 2) Pointing errors reflect to a significant extent the erroneous estimation of initial hand position. This suggests that aimed hand movements are planned vectorially, i.e., in terms of distance and direction, rather than in terms of absolute position in space.},

Neurophysiol. 79: 1117–1123, 1998. The process of acquiring motor skills through the sustained performance of complex movements is associated with neural plasticity. However, it is unknown whether even simple movements, repeated over a short period of time, are effective in inducing cortical representational changes. Whether the motor cortex can retain specific kinematic aspects of a recently practiced movement is also unknown. We used focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex to evoke isolated and directionally consistent thumb movements. Thumb movements then were practiced in a different direction. Subsequently, TMS came to evoke movements in or near the recently practiced direction for several minutes before returning to the original direction. To initiate a change of the TMS-evoked movement direction, 15 or 30 min of continuous training were required in most of the subjects and, on two occasions, as little as 5 or 10 min. Substantially smaller effects followed more direct stimulation of corticofugal axons with transcranial electrical stimulation, pointing to cortex as the site of plasticity. These findings suggest that the training rapidly, and transiently, established a change in the cortical network representing the thumb, which encoded kinematic details of the practiced movement. This phenomenon may be regarded as a short-term memory for movement and be the first step of skill acquisition.},

Here we manipulated the time available to initiate movements after a target was specified, and studied the effects of predictable movement sequences, to systematically dissociate effects of the most recently executed movement from the movement required next. We found that directional biases due to recent movement history strongly depend upon movement preparation time, suggesting an important contribution from predictive planning. However predictive biases co-exist with an independent source of bias that depends only on recent movement history. The results indicate that past experience influences movement execution through a combination of temporally-stable processes that are strictly use-dependent, and dynamically-evolving and context-dependent processes that reflect prediction of future actions.},

Repeating movements toward a particular direction is known to have a dramatic effect on involuntary movements elicited by cortical stimulation—a phenomenon that has been termed use-dependent plasticity. However, analogous effects of repetition on behavior have proven elusive. Here, we show that movement repetition enhances the generation of similar movements in the future by reducing the time required to select and prepare the repeated movement. We further show that this reaction time advantage for repeated movements is attributable to more rapid, but still ﬂexible, preparation of the repeated movement rather than anticipation and covert advance preparation of the previously repeated movement. Our ﬁndings demonstrate a powerful and beneﬁcial effect of movement repetition on response preparation, which may represent a behavioral counterpart to use-dependent plasticity effects in primary motor cortex.},

	abstract = {Over the years since the discovery of dopamine in the neostriatum, we have learned much about the anatomy of this large subcortical nucleus. In rodents, it is one nucleus penetrated by many fibers from the cerebral cortex. In larger animals and in humans, the area is split by a bundle of mainly corticofugal axons into the caudate nucleus and putamen. Dopamine input to both is similar and except for the details of cortical afferents to the two parts the striatum seems to act as one structure. Its main function is expected to be the transfer of the information carried in its cortical inputs onward through the basal ganglia. Diseases of this area of brain are associated with movement disorders and much is made of the action of dopamine on the long-term stability of corticostriatal synapses. The cortex is not at all the only input to the area, however, and the thalamus has almost as many synapses with striatal output neurons as has the cortex. This chapter summarizes the contributions to the study of the involvement of thalamostriatal inputs presented at Dopamine 2013 and emphasizes that this input, though largely ignored, has important lessons for those interested in understanding the function of the basal ganglia.},

Alterations in the electrophysiological activity of the thalamostriatal circuit in PD have not been intensively studied. To further investigate this circuit, parafascicular nucleus (PF) single-unit spikes and dorsal striatum local ﬁeld potential (LFP) activities were simultaneously recorded in control and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats during inattentive rest or treadmill walking states. We classiﬁed the PF neurons into two predominant subtypes (PF I and PF II). During rest state, after dopamine loss, increased PF I spike and striatal LFP coherence was observed in the beta-frequency (12–35 Hz), with changed PF I neuronal ﬁring pattern and unchanged ﬁring rates of the two neuron subtypes. However, in a treadmill walking state, PF II neurons displayed markedly increased coherence to striatal beta oscillations in the dopamine-depleted rats, as well as an altered PF II neuronal ﬁring pattern and signiﬁcantly decreased ﬁring rates of the two neuron subtypes. The results indicate that in PD animals, state transition from rest to moving, such as treadmill walking, is associated with different PF neuron types and increased spike-LFP synchronization, which may provide new paradigms for understanding and treating PD. © 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO.},

Recent behavioral studies in rats revealed a selectively active medial prefronto-striosomal circuit during cost-beneﬁt decision-making. However, clarifying the input/output organization of striatal compartments has been diﬃcult because of its complex structure. We recently demonstrated that the source of thalamostriatal projections are highly organized in striatal compartments. This ﬁnding indicated that the functional properties of striatal compartments are inﬂuenced by their cortical and thalamic aﬀerents, presumably with diﬀerent time latencies. In addition, these aﬀerents likely support the unique dynamics of striosome and matrix compartments. In this manuscript, we review the anatomy of basal ganglia networks with regard to striosome/matrix structure. We place speciﬁc focus on thalamostriatal projections at the population and single neuron level.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons innervating the striatum, the main input structure of the basal ganglia. This creates an imbalance between dopaminergic inputs and cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) within the striatum. The eﬃcacy of anticholinergic drugs, one of the earliest therapy for PD before the discovery of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) suggests an increased cholinergic tone in this disease. The dopamine (DA)-acetylcholine (ACh) balance hypothesis is now revisited with the use of novel cutting-edge techniques (optogenetics, pharmacogenetics, new electrophysiological recordings). This review will provide the background of the speciﬁc contribution of ChIs to striatal microcircuit organization in physiological and pathological conditions. The second goal of this review is to delve into the respective contributions of nicotinic and muscarinic receptor cholinergic subunits to the control of striatal aﬀerent and eﬀerent neuronal systems. Special attention will be given to the role played by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in the regulation of striatal network which may have important implications in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for motor and cognitive impairment in PD.},

	abstract = {The role of the thalamus in complex cognitive behavior is a topic of increasing interest. Here we demonstrate that lesions of the nucleus reuniens (NRe), a midline thalamic nucleus interconnected with both hippocampal and prefrontal circuitry, lead to enhancement of executive behaviors typically associated with the prefrontal cortex. Rats were tested on four behavioral tasks: (1) the combined attention-memory (CAM) task, which simultaneously assessed attention to a visual target and memory for that target over a variable delay; (2) spatial memory using a radial arm maze, (3) discrimination and reversal learning using a touchscreen operant platform, and (4) decisionmaking with delayed outcomes. Following NRe lesions, the animals became more eﬃcient in their performance, responding with shorter reaction times but also less impulsively than controls. This change, combined with a decrease in perseverative responses, led to focused attention in the CAM task and accelerated learning in the visual discrimination task. There were no observed changes in tasks involving either spatial memory or value-based decision making. These data complement ongoing eﬀorts to understand the role of midline thalamic structures in human cognition, including the development of thalamic stimulation as a therapeutic strategy for acquired cognitive disabilities (Schiﬀ, 2008; Mair et al., 2011), and point to the NRe as a potential target for clinical intervention.},

	abstract = {Cholinergic interneurons provide rich local innervation of the striatum and play an important role in controlling behavior, as evidenced by the variety of movement and psychiatric disorders linked to disrupted striatal cholinergic transmission. Much progress has been made in recent years regarding our understanding of how these interneurons contribute to the processing of information in the striatum. In particular, investigation of the activity of presumed striatal cholinergic interneurons, identiﬁed as tonically active neurons or TANs in behaving animals, has pointed to their role in the signaling and learning of the motivational relevance of environmental stimuli. Although the bulk of this work has been conducted in monkeys, several studies have also been carried out in behaving rats, but information remains rather disparate across studies and it is still questionable whether rodent TANs correspond to TANs described in monkeys. Consequently, our current understanding of the function of cholinergic transmission in the striatum is challenged by the rapidly growing, but often confusing literature on the relationship between TAN activity and speciﬁc behaviors. As regards the precise nature of the information conveyed by the cholinergic TANs, a recent inﬂuential view emphasized that these local circuit neurons may play a special role in the processing of contextual information that is important for reinforcement learning and selection of appropriate actions. This review provides a summary of recent progress in TAN physiology from which it is proposed that striatal cholinergic interneurons are crucial elements for ﬂexible switching of behaviors under changing environmental conditions.

In this study, we performed optogenetic manipulations of the activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) to evaluate their contribution to the updating of a previously learned instrumental contingency. By modulating the activity of CINs, we identiﬁed that the inhibition of CINs impairs the update of actions to a contingency change. Remarkably, a manipulation that perturbs the activity of CINs, rather than inhibiting them also impaired the encoding of the change in contingency. These results emphasize that beyond an increase in the activity of CINs, the intact activity of these cells is required for the identiﬁcation of an instrumental contingency change.},

Furthermore, PF lesions disrupt the execution of correct motor actions in uncertain environments. Nevertheless, the circuitry of the PF and its contribution to action selection are poorly understood. We ﬁnd that, in mice, PF has the highest density of striatum-projecting neurons among all sub-cortical structures. This projection arises from transcriptionally and physiologically distinct classes of PF neurons that are also reciprocally connected with functionally distinct cortical regions, differentially innervate striatal neurons, and are not synaptically connected in PF. Thus, mouse PF contains heterogeneous neurons that are organized into parallel and independent associative, limbic, and somatosensory circuits. Furthermore, these subcircuits share motifs of cortical-PF-cortical and cortical-PF-striatum organization that allow each PF subregion, via its precise connectivity with cortex, to coordinate diverse inputs to striatum.},

These observations resulted in the hypothesis that the CM-Pf plays a pivotal role in goal-oriented behavior selection. We here set out to test this hypothesis with electrophysiological recordings from patients with electrodes implanted in CM-Pf for deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment of chronic neuropathic pain. Six patients participated in (1) an auditory three-class oddball experiment, which required a button press to target tones, but not to standard and deviant tones and in (2) a multi-speaker experiment with a target word that required attention selection and a target image that required response selection. Subjects showed transient neural responses (8–15 Hz) to the target tone and the target word. Two subjects additionally showed transient neural responses (15–25 Hz) to the target image. All sensory target stimuli were related to an internal goal and required a behavior selection (attention selection, response selection). In group analyses, neural responses were greater to target tones than deviant and standard tones and to target words than other task-relevant words that did not require attention selection. The transient neural responses occurred after the target stimuli but prior to the overt behavioral response. Our results demonstrate that in human subjects the CM-Pf is involved in signaling sensory inputs related to goal-oriented selection of behavior.},

The present experiments investigated whether the prelimbic cortex and subthalamic nucleus in male Long-Evans rats supports cue-guided switching in a conditional discrimination test. Rats learned in a cross-maze that a start arm cue (black or white) signaled which of two maze arms to enter for a food reward. The cue was switched every 3–6 trials. Baclofen and muscimol infused into the prelimbic cortex signiﬁcantly impaired performance by increasing switch trial errors, as well as trials immediately following a switch trial (perseveration) and after initially making a correct switch (maintenance error). NMDA receptor blockade in the subthalamic nucleus signiﬁcantly impaired performance by increasing switch errors and perseveration. Contralateral disconnection of these areas signiﬁcantly reduced conditional discrimination performance by increasing switch and perseverative errors.

We ﬁnd that activation of rILN inputs to the DS drives cholinergic interneuron burst-ﬁring behavior and DA D2 receptor-dependent post-burst pauses in cholinergic interneuron ﬁring. In vivo, optogenetic activation of this pathway drives reinforcement in a DA D1 receptor-dependent manner, and chemogenetic suppression of the rILN reduces dopaminergic nigrostriatal terminal activity as measured by ﬁber photometry. Altogether, these data provide evidence that the rILN activates striatal cholinergic interneurons to enhance the pursuit of reward through local striatal DA release and introduce an additional level of complexity in our understanding of striatal DA signaling.},

Using neural recordings, together with optogenetic terminal inhibition, we examine the contribution of M2 and PF projections on medium spiny projection neuron (MSN) activity as mice performed an anticipatory licking task. Each input has a similar contribution to striatal activity. By comparing how suppressing single or multiple projections altered striatal activity, we ﬁnd that cortical and thalamic input signals modulate MSN gain and that this effect is more pronounced in a temporally speciﬁc period of the task following the cue presentation.

	abstract = {Different compartments of striatum mediate distinctive behavior-control modes, notably goaldirected versus habitual behavior. Normally, animals move back and forth between these modes as they adapt to changing contingencies of reward. However, this ability is compromised when dopaminergic drugs are used as reinforcers. These facts suggest that a set of biological variables, which make striatal decision making both highly plastic and uniquely sensitive to dopamine, contribute both to normal switches among modes and to the susceptibility for excessive habit formation when dopaminergic drugs serve as rewards. Indeed, data have revealed an impressive number of plasticity- and dopamine-related neural factors that vary systematically (with either increasing or decreasing gradients) across the rostral-ventral-medial to caudal-dorsal-lateral axis within striatum, the same axis implicated in switches among behavioral modes. Computer simulations reported here show how a dopamine-dependent parallel learning algorithm, if applied within modeled cortico-striatal circuits with parameters that reflect these striatal gradients, can explain normal mode switching, both into the habitual mode and returns to goaldirected mode, while also exhibiting a susceptibility to excessive habit formation when a dopaminergic drug serves as reward. With the same parameters, the model also directly illuminates: why interval and probabilistic reinforcement schedules are more habit forming than fixed-ratio schedules; why extinction learning is not (and should not be) a mirror image of acquisition learning; and why striatal decisions guided by reward-guided learning typically exhibit a highly sensitive tradeoff between speed and accuracy.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this review is to bridge the gap between earlier literature on striatal cholinergic interneurons and mechanisms of microcircuit interaction demonstrated with the use of newly available tools. It is well known that the main source of the high level of acetylcholine in the striatum, compared to other brain regions, is the cholinergic interneurons. These interneurons provide an extensive local innervation that suggests they may be a key modulator of striatal microcircuits. Supporting this idea requires the consideration of functional properties of these interneurons, their inﬂuence on medium spiny neurons, other interneurons, and interactions with other synaptic regulators. Here, we underline the effects of intrastriatal and extrastriatal afferents onto cholinergic interneurons and discuss the activation of pre- and postsynaptic muscarinic and nicotinic receptors that participate in the modulation of intrastriatal neuronal interactions. We further address recent ﬁndings about corelease of other transmitters in cholinergic interneurons and actions of these interneurons in striosome and matrix compartments. In addition, we summarize recent evidence on acetylcholine-mediated striatal synaptic plasticity and propose roles for cholinergic interneurons in normal striatal physiology. A short examination of their role in neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and Tourette’s pathologies and dystonia is also included.},

Here, we recorded DMS and DLS neural activity in rats during training in a task promoting habitual lever pressing. Despite improving performance across sessions, clear changes in corresponding neural activity patterns were not evident in DMS or DLS during early training. Although DMS and DLS activity patterns were distinct during early training, their activity was similar following extended training. Finally, performance after extended training was not associated with DMS disengagement, as would be predicted from prior work. These results suggest that behavioral sequences may continue to engage both striatal regions long after initial acquisition, when skilled performance is consolidated.},

TANs pause their tonic ﬁring activity after excitatory stimuli from thalamic and cortical neurons in response to a sensory event or reward information. During the pause striatal dopamine concentration excursions are observed. However, functional interactions between the TAN pause and striatal dopamine release are poorly understood. Here we propose a TAN activity-dopamine relationship model and demonstrate that the TAN pause is likely a time window to gate phasic dopamine release and dopamine variations reciprocally modulate the TAN pause duration. Furthermore, this model is integrated into our previously published model of reward-based motor adaptation to demonstrate how phasic dopamine release is gated by the TAN pause to deliver reward information for reinforcement learning in a timely manner. We also show how TANdopamine interactions are affected by striatal dopamine deﬁciency to produce poor performance of motor adaptation.},

	abstract = {Within the striatum, cholinergic interneurons, electrophysiologically identiﬁed as tonically active neurons (TANs), represent a relatively homogeneous group in terms of their functional properties. They display typical pause in tonic ﬁring in response to rewarding events which are of crucial importance for reinforcement learning. These responses are uniformly distributed throughout the dorsal striatum (i.e., motor and associative striatum), but it is unknown, at least in monkeys, whether differences in the modulation of TAN activity exist in the ventral striatum (i.e., limbic striatum), a region specialized for processing of motivational information. To address this issue, we examined the activity of dorsal and ventral TANs in two monkeys trained on a Pavlovian conditioning task in which a visual stimulus preceded the delivery of liquid reward by a ﬁxed time interval. We found that the proportion of TANs responding to the stimulus predictive of reward did not vary signiﬁcantly across regions (58\%–80\%), whereas the fraction of TANs responding to reward was higher in the limbic striatum (100\%) compared to the motor (65\%) and associative striatum (52\%). By examining TAN modulation at the level of both the population and the individual neurons, we showed that the duration of pause responses to the stimulus and reward was longer in the ventral than in the dorsal striatal regions. Also, the magnitude of the pause was greater in ventral than dorsal striatum for the stimulus predictive of reward but not for the reward itself. We found similar region-speciﬁc differences in pause response duration to the stimulus when the timing of reward was less predictable (ﬁxed replaced by variable time interval). Regional variations in the duration and magnitude of the pause response were transferred from the stimulus to reward when reward was delivered in the absence of any predictive stimulus. It therefore appears that ventral TANs exhibit stronger responses to rewarding stimuli, compared to dorsal TANs. The high proportion of responsive neurons, combined with particular response features, support the notion that the ventral TAN system can be driven by speciﬁc synaptic inputs arising from afferent sources distinct from those targeting the dorsal TAN system.},

	abstract = {Striatal cholinergic interneurons, the so-called tonically active neurons (TANs), pause their ﬁring in response to sensory cues and rewards during classical conditioning and instrumental tasks. The respective pause responses observed can demonstrate many commonalities, such as constant latency and duration, synchronous occurrence in a population of cells, and coincidence with phasic activities of midbrain dopamine neurons (DANs) that signal reward predictions and errors. Pauses can however also show divergent properties. Pause latencies and durations can differ in a given TAN between appetitive vs. aversive outcomes in classical conditioning, initial excitation can be present or absent, and a second pause can variably follow a rebound. Despite more than 20 years of study, the functions of these pause responses are still elusive. Our understanding of pause function is hindered by an incomplete understanding of how pauses are generated. In this mini-review article, we compare pause types, as well as current key hypotheses for inputs underlying pauses that include dopamineinduced inhibition through D2-receptors, a GABA input from ventral tegmental area, and a prolonged afterhyperpolarization induced by excitatory input from the cortex or from the thalamus. We review how each of these mechanisms alone explains some but not all aspects of pause responses. These mechanisms might need to operate in speciﬁc but variable sets of sequences to generate a full range of pause responses. Alternatively, these mechanisms might operate in conjunction with an underlying control mechanism within cholinergic interneurons which could potentially provide a framework to generate the common themes and variations seen amongst pause responses.},

But what drives the activity of these interneurons is less well defined. To fill this gap, a combination of monosynaptic rabies virus mapping (msRVm), electrophysiological and optogenetic approaches were used in transgenic mice in which LTSIs expressed either Cre recombinase or a fluorescent reporter. The rabies virus studies revealed a striking similarity in the afferent connectomes of LTSIs and neighboring cholinergic interneurons, particularly regarding connections arising from the parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus and cingulate cortex. While optogenetic stimulation of cingulate inputs excited both cholinergic interneurons and LTSIs, thalamic stimulation excited cholinergic interneurons, but inhibited LTSIs. This inhibition was dependent on cholinergic interneurons and had two components: a previously described GABAergic element and one that was mediated by M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. In addition to this phasic signal, cholinergic interneurons tonically excited LTSIs through a distinct, M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor pathway. This coordinated cholinergic modulation of LTSIs predisposed them to rhythmically burst in response to phasic thalamic activity, potentially reconfiguring striatal circuitry in response to salient environmental stimuli.},

As a result, research is now turning to the next question of how these putative systems interact. For instance, how is overall control of behavior coordinated, and does learning occur independently within systems regardless of what system is in control? Behavioral, neuroimaging, and neuroscience data are somewhat mixed with respect to these questions. Human neuroimaging and animal lesion studies suggest independent learning and are mostly agnostic with respect to control. Human behavioral studies suggest active inhibition of behavioral output but have little to say regarding learning. The results of two perceptual category-learning experiments are described that strongly suggest that procedural learning does occur while the explicit system is in control of behavior and that this learning might be just as good as if the procedural system was controlling the response. These results are consistent with the idea that declarative memory systems inhibit the ability of the procedural system to access motor output systems but do not prevent procedural learning.},

	abstract = {When a person fails to obtain an expected reward from an object in the environment, they face a credit assignment problem: Did the absence of reward reflect an extrinsic property of the environment or an intrinsic error in motor execution? To explore this problem, we modified a popular decision-making task used in studies of reinforcement learning, the two-armed bandit task. We compared a version in which choices were indicated by key presses, the standard response in such tasks, to a version in which the choices were indicated by reaching movements, which affords execution failures. In the key press condition, participants exhibited a strong risk aversion bias; strikingly, this bias reversed in the reaching condition. This result can be explained by a reinforcement model wherein movement errors influence decision-making, either by gating reward prediction errors or by modifying an implicit representation of motor competence. Two further experiments support the gating hypothesis. First, we used a condition in which we provided visual cues indicative of movement errors but informed the participants that trial outcomes were independent of their actual movements. The main result was replicated, indicating that the gating process is independent of participants’ explicit sense of control. Second, individuals with cerebellar degeneration failed to modulate their behavior between the key press and reach conditions, providing converging evidence of an implicit influence of movement error signals on reinforcement learning. These results provide a mechanistically tractable solution to the credit assignment problem.},

	abstract = {Advice is a powerful tool for learning. But advice also presents the challenge of bridging the gap between the high-level representations that easily capture human advice and the low-level representations that systems must operate with using that advice. Drawing inspiration from studies on human motor skills and memory systems, we present an approach that converts human advice into synthetic or imagined training experiences, serving to scaffold the low-level representations of simple, reactive learning systems such as reinforcement learners. Research on using mental imagery and directed attention in motor and perceptual skills motivates our approach. We introduce the concept of a cognitive advice template for generating scripted, synthetic experiences and use saliency masking to further conceal irrelevant portions of training observations. We present experimental results for a deep reinforcement learning agent in a Minecraft-based game environment that show how such synthetic experiences improve performance, enabling the agent to achieve faster learning and higher rates of success.},

Both experiments used a hybrid category-learning task in which perfect accuracy could be achieved if a declarative strategy is used on some trials and a procedural strategy is used on others. In the two experiments, only 2 of 53 participants learned a strategy of this type. In Experiment 1, most participants appeared to use simple explicit rules, even though control participants reliably learned the procedural component of the hybrid task. In Experiment 2, participants pre-trained either with the declarative or procedural component and then transferred to the hybrid categories. Despite this extra training, no participants in either group learned to categorize the hybrid stimuli with a strategy of the optimal type. These results are inconsistent with the most prominent single- and multiple-system accounts of category learning. They also cannot be explained by knowledge partitioning, or by the hypothesis that the failure to learn was due to high switch costs. Instead, these results support the hypothesis that declarative and procedural memory systems interact during category learning.},

In information-integration category-learning tasks, this purported process is thought to depend on procedural learning implemented via dopamine-dependent cortical-striatal synaptic plasticity. This article proposes a new, neurobiologically detailed model of procedural category learning that, unlike previous models, does not assume associations are made directly from stimulus to response. Rather, the traditional stimulus-response (S-R) models are replaced with a two-stage learning process. Multiple streams of evidence (behavioral, as well as anatomical and fMRI) are used as inspiration for the new model, which synthesizes evidence of multiple distinct cortical-striatal loops into a neurocomputational theory. An experiment is reported to test a priori predictions of the new model that: (1) recovery from a full reversal should be easier than learning new categories equated for difficulty, and (2) reversal learning in procedural tasks is mediated within the striatum via dopamine-dependent synaptic plasticity. The results confirm the predictions of the new two-stage model and are incompatible with existing S-R models.},

Humans strongly dimensionalized the stimuli and learned the rule-based task far more quickly. Six macaques showed the same performance advantage in the rule-based task. In humans, rule-based category learning is linked to explicit cognition, consciousness, and declarative reports about the contents of cognition.

The rule-based and information-integration tasks, respectively, had onedimensional and two-dimensional solutions. Capuchins, like humans, strongly dimensionalized the stimuli and learned the rule-based task more easily. The results strengthen the suggestion that nonhuman primates have some structural components of humans’ capacity for explicit categorization, which in humans is linked to declarative cognition and consciousness. The results also strengthen the primate contrast to other vertebrate species that may lack the explicit system.

This article introduces a new modeling procedure called iterative decision bound modeling (iDBM), which iteratively ﬁts decision bound models to the trial-by-trial responses generated from single participants in perceptual categorization experiments. The goals of iDBM are to identify: (1) all response strategies used by a participant, (2) changes in response strategy, and (3) the trial number at which each change occurs. The new method is validated by testing its ability to identify the response strategies used in noisy simulated data. The benchmark simulation results show that iDBM is able to detect and identify strategy switches during an experiment and accurately estimate the trial number at which the strategy change occurs in low to moderate noise conditions. The new method was then used to reanalyze data from Ell and Ashby (2006). Applying iDBM revealed that increasing category overlap in an information-integration category learning task increased the proportion of participants who abandoned explicit rules, and reduced the number of training trials needed to abandon rules in favor of a procedural strategy. Finally, we discuss new research questions made possible through iDBM.},

However, much less is known about the interaction between these systems: how is control passed between systems as they interact to inﬂuence motor resources? Here, we used fMRI to elucidate the neural correlates of switching between procedural and declarative categorization systems. We identiﬁed a key region of the cerebellum (left Crus I) whose activity was bidirectionally modulated depending on switch direction. We also identiﬁed regions of the default mode network (DMN) that were selectively connected to left Crus I during switching.

We propose the multiattribute linear ballistic accumulator (MLBA), a new dynamic model that provides a quantitative account of all 3 context effects. Our account applies not only to traditional paradigms involving choices among hedonic stimuli, but also to recent demonstrations of context effects with nonhedonic stimuli. Because of its computational tractability, the MLBA model is more easily applied than previous dynamic models. We show that the model also accounts for a range of other phenomena in multiattribute, multialternative choice, including time pressure effects, and that it makes a new prediction about the relationship between deliberation time and the magnitude of the similarity effect, which we confirm experimentally.},

We rigorously test the assumption that emphasizing decision speed versus decision accuracy selectively influences only decision thresholds. In data from a new brightness discrimination experiment we found that emphasizing decision speed over decision accuracy not only decreases the amount of evidence required for a decision but also decreases the quality of information being accumulated during the decision process. This result was consistent for 2 leading decision-making models and in a model-free test. We also found the same model-based results in archival data from a lexical decision task (reported by Wagenmakers, Ratcliff, Gomez, \& McKoon, 2008) and new data from a recognition memory task.

Two types of knowledge restructuring are supported by existing category learning models. The ﬁrst is a relearning process, which involves incremental updating of knowledge as learning progresses. The second is a recoordination process, which involves novel changes in the way existing knowledge is applied to the task. Whereas relearning is supported by both single- and multiple-module models of category learning, only multiple-module models support recoordination. To date, only relearning has been directly supported empirically. We report two category learning experiments that provide direct evidence of recoordination. People can ﬂuidly alternate between different categorization strategies, and moreover, can reinstate an old strategy even after prolonged use of an alternative. The knowledge restructuring data are not well ﬁt by a single-module model (ALCOVE). By contrast, a multiple-module model (ATRIUM) quantitatively accounts for recoordination. Low-level changes in the distribution of dimensional attention are shown to subsequently affect how ATRIUM coordinates its modular knowledge. We argue that learning about complex tasks occurs at the level of the partial knowledge elements used to generate a response strategy.},

These solutions (and freely-available computer code) make the model easy to apply to both binary and multiple choice situations. Using data from ﬁve previously published experiments, we demonstrate that the LBA model successfully accommodates empirical phenomena from binary and multiple choice tasks that have proven diﬃcult for other theoretical accounts.

Classic debates between single-system and multiple-memory-system theories have become more nuanced and focused.

In MCPL, normatively irrelevant cues are usually ignored, which stands in apparent conflict with recent research in deterministic categorization which has shown that people sometimes use irrelevant cues to gate access to partial knowledge encapsulated in independent partitions. We report two experiments that sought support for the existence of such knowledge partitioning in probabilistic categorization. The results indicate that, as in other areas of concept acquisition such as function learning and deterministic categorization, a significant proportion of participants partition their knowledge on the basis of an irrelevant cue. We show by computational modeling that knowledge partitioning cannot be accommodated by two exemplar models (GCM and RASHNL) whereas a rule-based model (GRT) can capture partitioned performance. We conclude by pointing to the necessity of a mixture-of-experts approach to capture performance in MCPL and identifying reduction of complexity as a possible explanation for partitioning.},

	abstract = {Delayed feedback during categorization training has been hypothesized to differentially affect 2 systems that underlie learning for rule-based (RB) or information-integration (II) structures. We tested an alternative possibility: that II learning requires more precise item representations than RB learning, and so is harmed more by a delay interval filled with a confusable mask. Experiments 1 and 2 examined the effect of feedback delay on memory for RB and II exemplars, both without and with concurrent categorization training. Without the training, II items were indeed more difficult to recognize than RB items, but there was no detectable effect of delay on item memory. In contrast, with concurrent categorization training, there were effects of both category structure and delayed feedback on item memory, which were related to corresponding changes in category learning. However, we did not observe the critical selective impact of delay on II classification performance that has been shown previously. Our own results were also confirmed in a follow-up study (Experiment 3) involving only categorization training. The selective influence of feedback delay on II learning appears to be contingent on the relative size of subgroups of high-performing participants, and in fact does not support that RB and II category learning are qualitatively different. We conclude that a key part of successfully solving perceptual categorization problems is developing more precise item representations, which can be impaired by delayed feedback during training. More important, the evidence for multiple systems of category learning is even weaker than previously proposed.},

	abstract = {The traditional animal model of instrumental behavior has focused almost exclusively on structures within the cortico-striatal network and ignored the contributions of various thalamic nuclei despite large and speciﬁc connections with each of these structures. One possible reason for this is that the thalamus has been conventionally viewed as a mediator of general processes, such as attention, arousal and movement, that are not easily separated from more cognitive aspects of instrumental behavior. Recent research has, however, begun to separate these roles. Here we review the role of three thalamic nuclei in instrumental conditioning: the anterior thalamic nuclei (ANT), the mediodorsal (MD), and parafascicular thalamic nuclei (PF). Early research suggested that ANT might regulate aspects of instrumental behavior but, on review, we suggest that the types of tasks used in these studies were more likely to recruit Pavlovian processes. Indeed lesions of ANT have been found to have no effect on performance in instrumental free-operant tasks. By contrast the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) has been found to play a speciﬁc and important role in the acquisition of goal-directed action. We propose this role is related to its connections with prelimbic cortex (PL) and present new data that directly implicates this circuit in the acquisition of goal-directed actions. Finally we review evidence suggesting the PF, although not critical for the acquisition or performance of instrumental actions, plays a speciﬁc role in regulating action ﬂexibility.},

	abstract = {The strength of conclusions about the adoption of different categorization strategies—and their implications for theories about the cognitive and neural bases of category learning— depend heavily on the techniques for identifying strategy use. We examine performance in an often-used “informationintegration” category structure and demonstrate that strategy identification is affected markedly by the range of models under consideration, the type of data collected, and model-selection techniques. We use a set of 27 potential models that represent alternative rule-based and information-integration categorization strategies. Our experimental paradigm includes the presentation of nonreinforced transfer stimuli that improve one’s ability to discriminate among the predictions of alternative models. Our modelselection techniques incorporate uncertainty in the identification of individuals as either rule-based or information-integration strategy users. Based on this analysis we identify 48\% of participants as unequivocally using an information-integration strategy. However, adopting the standard practice of using a restricted set of models, restricted data, and ignoring the degree of support for a particular strategy, we would typically conclude that 89\% of participants used an information-integration strategy. We discuss the implications of potentially erroneous strategy identification for the security of conclusions about the categorization capabilities of various participant and patient groups.},

	abstract = {For goal-directed action to remain adaptive, new strategies are required to accommodate environmental changes, a process for which parafascicular thalamic modulation of cholinergic interneurons in the striatum (PF-to-CIN) appears critical. In the elderly, however, previously acquired experience frequently interferes with new learning, yet the source of this effect has remained unexplored. Here, combining sophisticated behavioral designs, cell-speciﬁc manipulation, and extensive neuronal imaging, we investigated the involvement of the PF-to-CIN pathway in this process. We found functional alterations of this circuit in aged mice that were consistent with their incapacity to update initial goal-directed learning, resulting in faulty activation of projection neurons in the striatum. Toxicogenetic ablation of CINs in young mice reproduced these behavioral and neuronal defects, suggesting that age-related deﬁcits in PF-to-CIN function reduce the ability of older individuals to resolve conﬂict between actions, likely contributing to impairments in adaptive goal-directed action and executive control in aging.},

	abstract = {The dorsal striatum has two functionally-deﬁned subdivisions: a dorsomedial striatum (DMS) region involved in mediating goal-directed behaviors that require conscious effort, and a dorsolateral striatum (DLS) region involved in the execution of habitual behaviors in a familiar sensory context. Consistent with its presumed role in forming stimulus-response (S-R) associations, neurons in DLS receive massive inputs from sensorimotor cortex and are responsive to both active and passive sensory stimulation. While several studies have established that corticostriatal inputs contribute to the stimulus-induced responses observed in the DLS, there is growing awareness that the thalamus has a signiﬁcant role in conveying sensory-related information to DLS and other parts of the striatum. The thalamostriatal projections to DLS originate mainly from the caudal intralaminar region, which contains the parafascicular (Pf) nucleus, and from higher-order thalamic nuclei such as the medial part of the posterior (POm) nucleus. Based on recent ﬁndings, we hypothesize that the thalamostriatal projections from these two regions exert opposing inﬂuences on the expression of behavioral habits. This article reviews the subcortical circuits that regulate the transmission of sensory information through these thalamostriatal projection systems, and describes the evidence that indicates these circuits could be manipulated to ameliorate the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and related neurological disorders.},

In the current study participants were presented with stimulus displays that afforded two simple cognitive tasks and were required to switch predictably between them. The judgements for each task were either uniquely mapped onto separate effectors (univalent conditions) or else mapped onto shared effectors (bivalent condition). The results demonstrated that whilst behavioural switch costs were similar across the mapping conditions, these conditions differed in the patterns of brain activity observed during task preparation and early visual processing of the target. Specifically, a cue-locked switch-related late frontal negativity was present over frontal sensors for the bivalent condition only, and a target-locked N1 over occipital sensors was larger in the bivalent condition than the univalent conditions. In contrast, a switch-related target-locked P3b component was common to all mapping conditions. These findings are discussed with respect to differences in processing demands for switching between tasks with bivalent versus univalent responses.},

Since the same motor behavior can have different meanings in different task situations, we often have to change the meaning of our responses when we get into a different task context. In a functional MRI experiment we manipulated this response recoding process. Subjects were required to execute two simple spatial tasks in a task switching paradigm. In one condition both tasks required the same set of responses, hence each response had two different meanings depending on the relevant task (bivalent condition). In the other condition subjects used a separate set of responses for each task (univalent condition). While subjects were required to recode the meaning when switching from one task to the next in the bivalent condition, response recoding was not required in the univalent condition. We demonstrate that the lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in recoding of response meaning. These results extend previous assumptions on the role of the prefrontal cortex in behavioral control.},

Experiment 1 supported the hypothesis that mixed-tasks trials require the resolution of task ambiguity by showing that MC existed only with ambiguous stimuli that afforded both tasks and not with unambiguous stimuli affording only 1 task. Experiment 2 failed to support the hypothesis that holding multiple task sets in working memory (WM) generates MC by showing that systematic manipulation of the number of stimulus–response rules in WM did not affect MC.

We consider this new knowledge in relation to three factors proposed earlier to describe the rules for synaptic plasticity in the corticostriatal pathway. These factors are a phasic increase in dopamine release, presynaptic activity and postsynaptic depolarisation. A function is proposed which relates the amount of dopamine release in the striatum to the modulation of corticostriatal synaptic efﬁcacy. It is argued that this function, and the experimental data from which it arises, are compatible with existing models which associate the reward-related ﬁring of dopamine neurons with changes in corticostriatal synaptic efﬁcacy. q 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In a changing environment, plasticity has to remain ﬂexible, requiring interference between new and existing learning to be minimized, yet it is not known how new and existing learning are interlaced in this way. Here we investigated the role of the thalamostriatal pathway linking the parafascicular thalamus (Pf) with cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the pDMS in this process. Removing the excitatory input from Pf to the CINs was found to reduce the ﬁring rate and intrinsic activity of these neurons and produced an enduring deﬁcit in goal-directed learning after changes in the action-outcome contingency. Disconnection of the Pf-pDMS pathway produced similar behavioral effects. These data suggest that CINs reduce interference between new and existing learning, consistent with claims that the thalamostriatal pathway exerts state control over learning-related plasticity.},

	abstract = {Retrieval can render memories labile, allowing them to be modiﬁed or erased by behavioral or pharmacological intervention. This phenomenon, known as reconsolidation, deﬁes explanation in terms of classical associative learning theories, prompting a reconsideration of basic learning mechanisms in the brain. We propose that two mechanisms interact to produce reconsolidation: an associative learning mechanism of the form posited by classical theories, and a structure learning mechanism that discovers the units of association by segmenting the stream of experience into statistically distinct clusters (latent causes). We derive this framework from statistical principles, and present a mechanistic implementation. Simulations demonstrate that it can reproduce the major experimental ﬁndings from studies of reconsolidation, including dependence on the strength and age of memories, the interval between memory retrieval and extinction, and prediction errors following retrieval. In addition, we present new experimental data conﬁrming the theory’s prediction that performing part of extinction prior to retrieval attenuates reconsolidation.},

The ideal CCN model should not make any assumptions that are known to contradict the current neuroscience literature and at the same time provide good accounts of behavior and at least some neuroscience data (e.g., single-neuron activity, fMRI data). Furthermore, once set, the architecture of the CCN network and the models of each individual unit should remain fixed throughout all applications. Because of the greater weight they place on biological accuracy, CCN models differ substantially from traditional neural network models in how each individual unit is modeled, how learning is modeled, and how behavior is generated from the network. A variety of CCN solutions to these three problems are described. A real example of this approach is described, and some advantages and limitations of the CCN approach are discussed.},

	abstract = {The notion of “context” has played an important but complicated role in animal learning theory. Some studies have found that contextual stimuli (e.g., conditioning chamber) act much like punctate stimuli, entering into competition with other cues as would be predicted by standard associative learning theories. Other studies have found that contextual stimuli act more like “occasion setters,” modulating the associative strength of punctate stimuli without themselves acquiring associative strength. Yet other studies have found that context is often largely ignored, resulting in transfer of performance across context changes. This article argues that these diverse functions of context arise in part from different causal interpretations of the environment. A Bayesian theory is presented that infers which causal interpretation best explains an animal’s training history, and hence which function of context is appropriate. The theory coherently accounts for a number of disparate experimental results, and quantitatively predicts the results of a new experiment designed to directly test the theory.},

	abstract = {The projection from the thalamic centre médian–parafascicular (CM-Pf) complex to the caudate nucleus and putamen forms a massive striatal input system in primates. We examined the activity of 118 neurons in the CM and 62 neurons in the Pf nuclei of the thalamus and 310 tonically active neurons (TANs) in the striatum in awake behaving macaque monkeys and analyzed the effects of pharmacologic inactivation of the CM-Pf on the sensory responsiveness of the striatal TANs. A large proportion of CM and Pf neurons responded to visual (53\%) and/or auditory beep (61\%) or click (91\%) stimuli presented in behavioral tasks, and many responded to unexpected auditory, visual, or somatosensory stimuli presented outside the task context. The neurons fell into two classes: those having short-latency facilitatory responses (SLF neurons, predominantly in the Pf) and those having long-latency facilitatory responses (LLF neurons, predominantly in the CM). Responses of both types of neuron appeared regardless of whether or not the sensory stimuli were associated with reward. These response characteristics of CM-Pf neurons sharply contrasted with those of TANs in the striatum, which under the same conditions responded preferentially to stimuli associated with reward. Many CM-Pf neurons responded to alerting stimuli such as unexpected handclaps and noises only for the first few times that they occurred; after that, the identical stimuli gradually became ineffective in evoking responses. Habituation of sensory responses was particularly common for the LLF neurons. Inactivation of neuronal activity in the CM and Pf by local infusion of the GABA
              A
              receptor agonist, muscimol, almost completely abolished the pause and rebound facilitatory responses of TANs in the striatum. Such injections also diminished behavioral responses to stimuli associated with reward. We suggest that neurons in the CM and Pf supply striatal neurons with information about behaviorally significant sensory events that can activate conditional responses of striatal neurons in combination with dopamine-mediated nigrostriatal inputs having motivational value.},

In addition to cell body labeling in monkeys, all areas of humans and monkeys had a neuropil label with a laminar distribution predicted by previous Di receptor autoradiography studies. Using electron microscopy, this neuropil label was seen in numerous dendritic spines, in dendritic shafts, and in occasional axon terminals. While labeled spines were common, they represented only a subset of all cortical spines. Serial sectioning through labeled spines showed that the diaminobenzidine reaction product was usually not at postsynaptic densities but instead was displaced to the side of the large asymmetric (presumed glutamatergic) synapse. Furthermore, most labeled spines did not receive synapses with dopaminergic features, suggesting that many D1 receptors are at extrasynaptic sites, possibly receiving dopamine via diffusion in the neuropil. Similarly, double labeling failed to reveal D1 labeling at synapses of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive axons. Localization to numerous dendritic spines suggests that a primary role of D1 receptors is modulation of glutamatergic input to cortical pyramidal cells.},

	abstract = {A balanced interaction between dopaminergic and cholinergic signaling in the striatum is critical to goal-directed behavior. But how this interaction modulates corticostriatal synaptic plasticity underlying learned actions remains unclear—particularly in direct-pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs). Our studies show that in dSPNs, endogenous cholinergic signaling through M4 muscarinic receptors (M4Rs) promoted long-term depression of corticostriatal glutamatergic synapses, by suppressing regulator of G protein signaling type 4 (RGS4) activity, and blocked D1 dopamine receptor dependent longterm potentiation (LTP). Furthermore, in a mouse model of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)induced dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson’s disease (PD), boosting M4R signaling with positive allosteric modulator (PAM) blocked aberrant LTP in dSPNs, enabled LTP reversal, and attenuated dyskinetic behaviors. An M4R PAM also was effective in a primate LID model. Taken together, these studies identify an important signaling pathway controlling striatal synaptic plasticity and point to a novel pharmacological strategy for alleviating LID in PD patients.},

The sample size of highly cited experimental fMRI studies increased at a rate of 0.74 participant/year and this rate of increase was commensurate with the median sample sizes of neuroimaging studies published in top neuroimaging journals in 2017 (23 participants) and 2018 (24 participants).

Sixtyfour participants engaged in the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST) or a no-stress control condition either immediately before (i.e., proximate condition) or 30 min before (i.e., distant condition) a picture encoding task. In general, stress decreased the number of freely recalled and recognized pictures and increased the number of false alarms. However, timing of stress exposure did not differentially affect picture recall, recognition or selective attention processes (i.e., LPP). Nevertheless, stress-induced cortisol responses and correctly recognized neutral pictures were positively associated within the proximate stress condition but negatively associated within the distant stress condition. These ﬁndings suggest that the time at which a stressor is applied might differentially impact the association between stress-induced cortisol elevations and memory formation and indicate the need for a ﬁner delineation of the time window during which glucocorticoids affect memory formation processes.},

Analysis of the computations underlying supervised learning is facilitated by the relatively simple and uniform architecture of the cerebellum, a brain area that supports numerous motor, sensory, and cognitive functions. We highlight recent discoveries indicating that the cerebellum implements supervised learning using the following organizational principles: (a) extensive preprocessing of input representations (i.e., feature engineering), (b) massively recurrent circuit architecture, (c) linear input–output computations, (d) sophisticated instructive signals that can be regulated and are predictive, (e) adaptive mechanisms of plasticity with multiple timescales, and ( f ) task-speciﬁc hardware specializations. The principles emerging from studies of the cerebellum have striking parallels with those in other brain areas and in artiﬁcial neural networks, as well as some notable differences, which can inform future research on supervised learning and inspire next-generation machine-based algorithms.},

The term “super-learning” does not indicate a new learning paradigm. Rather, it refers to the fact that diﬀerent learning mechanisms act in synergy as they: (a) aﬀect neural structures often relying on the widespread action of neuromodulators; (b) act within various stages of cortical/subcortical pathways that are organised in pipeline to support multiple sensation-toaction mappings operating at diﬀerent levels of abstraction; (c) interact through the reciprocal inﬂuence of the output compartments of diﬀerent brain structures, most notably in the cerebello-cortical and basal gangliacortical loops. Here we articulate this new hypothesis and discuss empirical evidence supporting it by speciﬁcally referring to motor adaptation and sequence learning.},

However, recent work highlights the addition of a conditioned Purkinje cell complex spike response, which at the level of the interposed nucleus seems to translate to a transient spike suppression that can be followed by a rapid spike facilitation.

The theories of the universal cerebellar transform and dysmetria of thought and the principles of organization of cerebral cortical connections, together with neuroanatomical, brain imaging, and clinical observations, have recontextualized the cerebellum as a critical node in the distributed neural circuits subserving behavior. The framework for cerebellar cognition stems from the identification of three cognitive representations in the posterior lobe, which are interconnected with cerebral association areas and distinct from the primary and secondary cerebellar sensorimotor representations linked with the spinal cord and cerebral motor areas. Lesions of the anterior lobe primary sensorimotor representations produce dysmetria of movement, the cerebellar motor syndrome. Lesions of the posterior lobe cognitive-emotional cerebellum produce dysmetria of thought and emotion, the cerebellar cognitive affective/Schmahmann syndrome. The notion that the cerebellum modulates thought and emotion in the same way that it modulates motor control advances the understanding of the mechanisms of cognition and opens new therapeutic opportunities in behavioral neurology and neuropsychiatry.},

Such addictions can also be defined in terms of the brain mechanisms they activate; most addictive drugs cause elevations in extracellular levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Animals unable to synthesize or use dopamine lack the conditioned reflexes discussed by Pavlov or the appetitive behavior discussed by Craig; they have only unconditioned consummatory reflexes. Burst discharges (phasic firing) of dopamine-containing neurons are necessary to establish long-term memories associating predictive stimuli with rewards and punishers. Independent discharges of dopamine neurons (tonic or pacemaker firing) determine the motivation to respond to such cues. As a result of habitual intake of addictive drugs, dopamine receptors expressed in the brain are decreased, thereby reducing interest in activities not already stamped in by habitual rewards.},

The striatum also receives dopaminergic inputs that can signal reward prediction errors and also behavioral transitions and movement initiation. Here we review studies and models of how direct and indirect pathways can modulate basal ganglia outputs to facilitate movement initiation, and we discuss the role of cortical and dopaminergic inputs to the striatum in determining what to do and if and when to do it. Complex but exciting scenarios emerge that shed new light on how basal ganglia circuits modulate self-paced movement initiation.},

	abstract = {We review the psychology and neuroscience of reinforcement learning (RL), which has experienced signiﬁcant progress in the past two decades, enabled by the comprehensive experimental study of simple learning and decisionmaking tasks. However, one challenge in the study of RL is computational: The simplicity of these tasks ignores important aspects of reinforcement learning in the real world: (a) State spaces are high-dimensional, continuous, and partially observable; this implies that (b) data are relatively sparse and, indeed, precisely the same situation may never be encountered twice; furthermore, (c) rewards depend on the long-term consequences of actions in ways that violate the classical assumptions that make RL tractable. A seemingly distinct challenge is that, cognitively, theories of RL have largely involved procedural and semantic memory, the way in which knowledge about action values or world models extracted gradually from many experiences can drive choice. This focus on semantic memory leaves out many aspects of memory, such as episodic memory, related to the traces of individual events. We suggest that these two challenges are related. The computational challenge can be dealt with, in part, by endowing RL systems with episodic memory, allowing them to (a) efﬁciently approximate value functions over complex state spaces, (b) learn with very little data, and (c) bridge long-term dependencies between actions and rewards. We review the computational theory underlying this proposal and the empirical evidence to support it. Our proposal suggests that the ubiquitous and diverse roles of memory in RL may function as part of an integrated learning system.},

Despite two decades of research, it remains unclear how dopamine neurons make this calculation. Here we review studies that tackle this problem from a diverse set of approaches, from anatomy to electrophysiology to computational modeling and behavior. Several patterns emerge from this synthesis: that dopamine neurons themselves calculate reward prediction error, rather than inherit it passively from upstream regions; that they combine multiple separate and redundant inputs, which are themselves interconnected in a dense recurrent network; and that despite the complexity of inputs, the output from dopamine neurons is remarkably homogeneous and robust. The more we study this simple arithmetic computation, the knottier it appears to be, suggesting a daunting (but stimulating) path ahead for neuroscience more generally.},

Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas.

We posit that through the use of reinforcement learning, the need for explicit teacher signals for learning in the cerebellum is eliminated; instead, learning can occur via responses from evaluative feedback. We demonstrate the learning capacity of cerebellar reinforcement learning using simple computer simulations of delay eyeblink conditioning and the cart-pole balancing task.},

	abstract = {Reservoir computing is a computational framework suited for temporal/sequential data processing. It is derived from several recurrent neural network models, including echo state networks and liquid state machines. A reservoir computing system consists of a reservoir for mapping inputs into a high-dimensional space and a readout for pattern analysis from the high-dimensional states in the reservoir. The reservoir is fixed and only the readout is trained with a simple method such as linear regression and classification. Thus, the major advantage of reservoir computing compared to other recurrent neural networks is fast learning, resulting in low training cost. Another advantage is that the reservoir without adaptive updating is amenable to hardware implementation using a variety of physical systems, substrates, and devices. In fact, such physical reservoir computing has attracted increasing attention in diverse fields of research. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of recent advances in physical reservoir computing by classifying them according to the type of the reservoir. We discuss the current issues and perspectives related to physical reservoir computing, in order to further expand its practical applications and develop next-generation machine learning systems.},

	abstract = {In reinforcement learning theories of the basal ganglia, there is a need for the expected rewards corresponding to relevant environmental states to be maintained and modiﬁed during the learning process. However, the representation of these states that allows them to be associated with reward expectations remains unclear. Previous studies have tended to rely on pre-deﬁned partitioning of states encoded by disjunct neuronal groups or sparse topological drives. A more likely scenario is that striatal neurons are involved in the encoding of multiple different states through their spike patterns, and that an appropriate partitioning of an environment is learned on the basis of task constraints, thus minimizing the number of states involved in solving a particular task. Here we show that striatal activity is sufﬁcient to implement a liquid state, an important prerequisite for such a computation, whereby transient patterns of striatal activity are mapped onto the relevant states. We develop a simple small scale model of the striatum which can reproduce key features of the experimentally observed activity of the major cell types of the striatum. We then use the activity of this network as input for the supervised training of four simple linear readouts to learn three different functions on a plane, where the network is stimulated with the spike coded position of the agent. We discover that the network conﬁguration that best reproduces striatal activity statistics lies on the edge of chaos and has good performance on all three tasks, but that in general, the edge of chaos is a poor predictor of network performance.},

In the present experiment, the effects of lesions of the dorsolateral and dorsomedial striatum were investigated on two tasks that differentially require the development of stimulus-response learning. The ﬁrst task utilized an operant conditional discrimination task, which is likely to rely heavily upon stimulusresponse learning. The second task looked conditioned place preference learning, a task that is unlikely to require the development of stimulus-response associations. Animals with lesions of the dorsolateral striatum were impaired on the operant conditional discrimination task, but retained the ability to learn the conditioned place preference task. In contrast, animals with lesions of the dorsomedial striatum were not found to be impaired on either task used in the present experiment. These results suggest that the dorsolateral striatum is necessary for the successful acquisition of tasks that place a demand upon stimulus-response learning, while the dorsomedial striatum is not involved in this type of learning. © 2004 IBRO.

However, since these studies investigated the effects of dorsal striatal lesions on task acquisition, which can be confounded by differences in level of reinforcement and motor impairment caused by the lesion, the interpretation of these ﬁndings was somewhat problematic. The present experiment was designed to address these issues by assessing the effects of lesions of the dorsolateral striatum on a simpliﬁed version of the conditional discrimination task, in which the importance of reinforcement and motor factors was minimized. Animals with lesions of the dorsolateral striatum showed marked impairments in learning this task, a ﬁnding that is in agreement with the notion that the dorsolateral striatum is necessary for stimulus-response learning. © 2005 IBRO.

Each new discrimination problem was solved on the basis of the secondary reinforcer, and primary reinforcement (food reward) was given only after a new problem had been solved. The animals learned 50 new problems in each daily session and it was therefore possible to assess accurately their average rate of learning new discrimination problems in this procedure. After the learning rate had stabilized preoperatively the animals were operated upon to transect the uncinate fascicle, the cortico-cortical pathway from visual association cortex in the temporal lobe to prefrontal cortex. The animals’ learning rate was unchanged after uncinate fascicle section. A previous experiment had shown that visual learning for an auditory secondary reinforcer is unaffected by disconnection of visual association cortex from the amygdala and the fornix. Taken together, this negative evidence points strongly to the conclusion that visual learning for an auditory secondary reinforcer depends upon interaction of temporal lobe visual association cortex with the corpus striatum, since other possibilities have been excluded.},

	abstract = {Feedback regarding an individual's action can occur immediately or with a temporal delay. Processing of feedback that varies in its delivery time is proposed to engage diﬀerent brain mechanisms. fMRI data implicate the striatum in the processing of immediate feedback, and the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in the processing of delayed feedback. The present study oﬀers an electrophysiological examination of feedback processing in the context of timing, by studying the eﬀects of feedback timing on the feedback-related negativity (FRN), a product of the midbrain dopamine system, and elucidating whether the N170 ERP component could capture MTL activation associated with the processing of delayed feedback. Participants completed a word-object paired association learning task; they received feedback 500 ms (immediate feedback condition) following a button press during the learning of two sets of 14 items, and at a delay of 6500 ms (delayed feedback condition) during the learning of the other two sets. The results indicated that while learning outcomes did not diﬀer under the two timing conditions, Event Related Potential (ERPs) pointed to diﬀerential activation of the examined ERP components. FRN amplitude was found to be larger following the immediate feedback condition when compared with the delayed feedback condition, and sensitive to valence and learning only under the immediate feedback condition. Additionally, the amplitude of the N170 was found larger following the delayed feedback condition when compared with the immediate feedback condition.

	abstract = {A comprehensive theory of cerebellar function is presented, which ties together the known anatomy and physiology of the cerebellum into a pattern-recognition data processing system. The cerebellum is postulated to be functionally and structurally equivalent to a modification of the classical Perceptron pattern-classification device. It is suggested that the mossy fiber ---fgranule cell --f Golgi cell input network performs an expansion recoding that enhances the pattern-discrimination capacity and learning speed of the cerebellar Purkinje response cells. Parallel fiber synapses of the dendritic spines of Purkinje cells, basket cells, and stellate cells are all postulated to be specifically variable in response to climbing fiber activity. It is argued that this variability is the mechanism of pattern storage. It is demonstrated that, in order for the learning process to be stable, pattern storage must be accomplished principally by weakening synaptic weights rather than by strengthening them.},

The unique architecture of the cerebellar cortex is ideally suited for pattern recognition, but how is pattern recognition incorporated into motor control and learning systems? The present analysis begins with a discussion of exactly what the cerebellar cortex needs to regulate through its anatomically defined projections to premotor networks. Next, we examine various models showing how the microcircuitry in the cerebellar cortex could be used to achieve its regulatory functions. Having thus defined what it is that Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex must learn, we then evaluate theories of motor learning. We examine current models of synaptic plasticity, credit assignment, and the generation of training information, indicating how they could function cooperatively to guide the processes of motor learning.},

In contrast, the central axis of motor and nonmotor macroscale organization in the cerebellum remains unknown. Here we applied diffusion map embedding to resting-state data from the Human Connectome Project dataset (n = 1003), and show for the first time that cerebellar functional regions follow a gradual organization which progresses from primary (motor) to transmodal (DMN, task-unfocused) regions. A secondary axis extends from task-unfocused to task-focused processing. Further, these two principal gradients revealed novel functional properties of the well-established cerebellar double motor representation (lobules I-VI and VIII), and its relationship with the recently described triple nonmotor representation (lobules VI/Crus I, Crus II/VIIB, IX/X). Functional differences exist not only between the two motor but also between the three nonmotor representations, and second motor representation might share functional similarities with third nonmotor representation.},

	abstract = {Network connectivity measured with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) has revealed the contribution of distinct cerebellar lobules to an array of brain wide networks sub-serving motor and cognitive processes. As distinct cerebellar lobules form relatively accessible nodes of different brain networks, this raises the possibility for site-speciﬁc modulation of network connectivity using non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Continuous theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) induces long-lasting inhibition of cortical areas. Although previous studies have shown that cTBS of the lateral cerebellum modulates motor cortical excitability and improves symptoms in several movement disorders, the effect on cognitive domains has not been examined. We explored the immediate effects of cTBS in a shamcontrolled study on the strength of intrinsic functional connectivity between cerebellar and cortical motor and cognitive regions in 12 participants. Lateral cerebellar cTBS signiﬁcantly decreased functional connectivity with frontal and parietal cognitive regions, while connectivity with motor regions remained unaltered. Sham stimulation had no effect on either motor or cognitive connectivity. These results show that inhibitory cerebellar stimulation reduces intrinsic functional connectivity between different cortical areas, in keeping with the known connectivity pattern of the cerebellum. The results highlight the plasticity of cerebello-cerebral networks and indicate for the ﬁrst time that this functional connectivity can be downregulated using an inhibitory neurostimulation paradigm. This may shed light on the pathophysiology of network dysfunction and is a potential treatment for cognitive and movement disorders.},

There is currently enough anatomical, physiological, and theoretical evidence to support the hypotheses that the cerebellum is a specialized organism for supervised learning, the basal ganglia are for reinforcement learning, and the cerebral cortex is for unsupervised learning.},

We assume that climbing fiber responses represent motor-command errors generated by some of the premotor networks such as the feedback controllers at the spinal-, brain stem- and cerebral levels. Thus, in our model, climbing fiber responses are considered to convey motor errors in the motor-command coordinates rather than in the sensory coordinates. Based on the long-term depression in Purkinje cells each corticonuclear microcomplex in different regions of the cerebellum learns to execute predictive and coordinative control of different types of movements. Ultimately, it acquires an inverse model of a specific controlled object and complements crude control by the premotor networks. This general model is developed in detail as a specific neural circuit model for the lateral hemisphere. A new experiment is suggested to elucidate the coordinate frame in which climbing fiber responses are represented.},

Here, we review the main forms of long-term plasticity in the cerebellar cortex that underlie motor learning. We propose that the different forms of plasticity in the granular layer and the molecular layer operate synergistically in a temporally and spatially distributed manner, so as to ultimately create optimal output for behaviour.},

Here, we show that modifications of the postsynaptic calcium load using the calcium chelator BAPTA or photolytic calcium uncaging result in a reversal of the expected polarity of synaptic gain change. At higher concentrations, BAPTA blocks PF-LTP. These data indicate that PF-LTD requires a higher calcium threshold amplitude than PF-LTP induction and suggest that CF activity acts as a polarity switch by providing dendritic calcium transients. Moreover, previous CF-LTD induction changes the relative PF-LTD versus -LTP induction probability. These findings suggest that bidirectional cerebellar learning is governed by a calcium threshold rule operating “inverse” to the mechanism previously described at other glutamatergic synapses (BCM rule) and that the LTD/LTP induction probability is under heterosynaptic climbing fiber control.},

	abstract = {The traditional view that the basal ganglia and cerebellum are simply involved in the control of movement has been challenged in recent years. One of the pivotal reasons for this reappraisal has been new information about basal ganglia and cerebellar connections with the cerebral cortex. In essence, recent anatomical studies have revealed that these connections are organized into discrete circuits or ‘loops’. Rather than serving as a means for widespread cortical areas to gain access to the motor system, these loops reciprocally interconnect a large and diverse set of cerebral cortical areas with the basal ganglia and cerebellum. The properties of neurons within the basal ganglia or cerebellar components of these circuits resembles the properties of neurons within the cortical areas subserved by these loops. For example, neuronal activity within basal ganglia and cerebellar loops with motor areas of the cerebral cortex is highly correlated with parameters of movement, while neuronal activity within basal ganglia and cerebellar loops with areas of the prefrontal cortex is more related to aspects of cognitive function. Thus, individual loops appear to be involved in distinct behavioral functions. Studies of basal ganglia and cerebellar pathology support this conclusion. Damage to the basal ganglia or cerebellar components of circuits with motor areas of cortex leads to motor symptoms, whereas damage of the subcortical components of circuits with non-motor areas of cortex causes higher-order deficits. In this report, we review some of the new anatomical, physiological and behavioral findings that have contributed to a reappraisal of function concerning the basal ganglia and cerebellar loops with the cerebral cortex. q 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

But how this interaction modulates corticostriatal synaptic plasticity underlying learned actions remains unclear—particularly in direct-pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs). Our studies show that in dSPNs, endogenous cholinergic signaling through M4 muscarinic receptors (M4Rs) promoted long-term depression of corticostriatal glutamatergic synapses, by suppressing regulator of G protein signaling type 4 (RGS4) activity, and blocked D1 dopamine receptor dependent longterm potentiation (LTP). Furthermore, in a mouse model of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)induced dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson’s disease (PD), boosting M4R signaling with positive allosteric modulator (PAM) blocked aberrant LTP in dSPNs, enabled LTP reversal, and attenuated dyskinetic behaviors. An M4R PAM also was effective in a primate LID model. Taken together, these studies identify an important signaling pathway controlling striatal synaptic plasticity and point to a novel pharmacological strategy for alleviating LID in PD patients.},

J Cogn Neurosci 23: 1549–1566, 2011) showed that a model grounded in the neurobiology of the basal ganglia could account for basic single-neuron recording data, as well as behavioral phenomena such as fast reacquisition that constrain models of conditioning. In this article we show that this same model accounts for a variety of appetitive instrumental conditioning phenomena, including the partial reinforcement extinction (PRE) effect, rapid and slowed reacquisition following extinction, and renewal of previously extinguished instrumental responses by environmental context cues.},

	abstract = {Empirical research has shown that the amygdala, hippocampus, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) are involved in fear conditioning. However, the functional contribution of each brain area and the nature of their interactions are not clearly understood. Here, we extend existing neural network models of the functional roles of the hippocampus in classical conditioning to include interactions with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. We apply the model to fear conditioning, in which animals learn physiological (e.g. heart rate) and behavioral (e.g. freezing) responses to stimuli that have been paired with a highly aversive event (e.g. electrical shock). The key feature of our model is that learning of these conditioned responses in the central nucleus of the amygdala is modulated by two separate processes, one from basolateral amygdala and signaling a positive prediction error, and one from the vmPFC, via the intercalated cells of the amygdala, and signaling a negative prediction error. In addition, we propose that hippocampal input to both vmPFC and basolateral amygdala is essential for contextual modulation of fear acquisition and extinction. The model is sufﬁcient to account for a body of data from various animal fear conditioning paradigms, including acquisition, extinction, reacquisition, and context speciﬁcity effects. Consistent with studies on lesioned animals, our model shows that damage to the vmPFC impairs extinction, while damage to the hippocampus impairs extinction in a different context (e.g., a different conditioning chamber from that used in initial training in animal experiments). We also discuss model limitations and predictions, including the effects of number of training trials on fear conditioning.},

Direct evidence supporting the proposal that the hippocampus is required for structural learning comes from recent lesion studies with rats. While rats with hippocampal lesions were impaired at relearning a set of spatial structural problems, they showed no impairment when relearning two conﬁgural tasks (transverse patterning and the biconditional discrimination), neither of which required structural learning. Other support comes from surveys of spatial and temporal learning by amnesic patients with hippocampal damage, and from imaging studies of both humans and rats. While these studies offer consistent support for the structural hypothesis, very few provide a rigorous test as the tasks can often be solved by other strategies. For this reason, the present review details the design features of future stringent tests of the structural hypothesis. VC 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Several recovery effects (renewal, spontaneous recovery, and reinstatement) after extinction suggest that the contextual modulation of extinction is a critical behavioral mechanism underlying fear extinction. In addition, recent studies demonstrate a critical role for hippocampus in the context control of extinction. A growing body of evidence suggests that the hippocampus not only plays a role in contextual encoding and retrieval of fear extinction memories, but also interacts with other brain structures to regulate context-speciﬁcity of fear extinction. In this article, the authors will ﬁrst discuss the fundamental behavioral features of the context effects of extinction and its underlying behavioral mechanisms.

	abstract = {Operant learning requires that reinforcement signals interact with action representations at a suitable neural interface. Much evidence suggests that this occurs when phasic dopamine, acting as a reinforcement prediction error, gates plasticity at cortico-striatal synapses, and thereby changes the future likelihood of selecting the action(s) coded by striatal neurons. But this hypothesis faces serious challenges. First, cortico-striatal plasticity is inexplicably complex, depending on spike timing, dopamine level, and dopamine receptor type. Second, there is a credit assignment problem—action selection signals occur long before the consequent dopamine reinforcement signal. Third, the two types of striatal output neuron have apparently opposite effects on action selection. Whether these factors rule out the interface hypothesis and how they interact to produce reinforcement learning is unknown. We present a computational framework that addresses these challenges. We first predict the expected activity changes over an operant task for both types of action-coding striatal neuron, and show they co-operate to promote action selection in learning and compete to promote action suppression in extinction. Separately, we derive a complete model of dopamine and spike-timing dependent cortico-striatal plasticity from in vitro data. We then show this model produces the predicted activity changes necessary for learning and extinction in an operant task, a remarkable convergence of a bottom-up data-driven plasticity model with the top-down behavioural requirements of learning theory. Moreover, we show the complex dependencies of cortico-striatal plasticity are not only sufficient but necessary for learning and extinction. Validating the model, we show it can account for behavioural data describing extinction, renewal, and reacquisition, and replicate in vitro experimental data on cortico-striatal plasticity. By bridging the levels between the single synapse and behaviour, our model shows how striatum acts as the action-reinforcement interface.},

A new experimental paradigm is developed that makes it possible to accurately estimate a subject's decision boundary in a categorization task. Three experiments using this paradigm are reported. Three conclusions stand out: (a) Subjects adopted deterministic decision rules, that is, for a given location in the perceptual space, most subjects always gave the same response; (b) subjects used decision rules that were nearly optimal; and (c) the only constraint on the type of decision bound that subjects used was the amount of cognitive capacity it required to implement. Subjects were not constrained to make independent decisions on each component or to attend to the distance to each prototype.},

Two basal ganglia pathways have been classically hypothesized to regulate this process via opposing roles in movement facilitation and suppression. By using a series of state-dependent optogenetic manipulations, we dissected the contributions of each pathway and found that both the direct striatonigral pathway and the indirect striatopallidal pathway are necessary for smooth initiation and the execution of learned action sequences. Optogenetic inhibition or stimulation of each pathway before sequence initiation increased the latency for initiation: manipulations of the striatonigral pathway activity slowed action initiation, and those of the striatopallidal pathway aborted action initiation. The inhibition of each pathway after initiation also impaired ongoing execution. Furthermore, the subtle activation of striatonigral neurons sustained the performance of learned sequences, while striatopallidal manipulations aborted ongoing performance. These results suggest a supportive versus permissive model, where patterns of coordinated activity, rather than the relative amount of activity in these pathways, regulate movement initiation and execution.},

We have found a remarkable anatomical plasticity in the basal ganglia of adult mice that is regulated by dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs). By modulating neuronal excitability, striatal D2Rs bidirectionally control the density of direct pathway collaterals in the globus pallidus that bridge the direct pathway with the functionally opposing indirect pathway. An increase in bridging collaterals is associated with enhanced inhibition of pallidal neurons in vivo and disrupted locomotor activation after optogenetic stimulation of the direct pathway. Chronic blockade with haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication used to treat schizophrenia, decreases the extent of bridging collaterals and rescues the locomotor imbalance. These ﬁndings identify a role for bridging collaterals in regulating the concerted balance of striatal output and may have important implications for understanding schizophrenia, a disease involving excessive activation of striatal D2Rs that is treated with D2R blockers.},

Deletion of Chl-D2Rs (Chl-Drd2KO) impaired LTD induction in both subtypes of MSNs. LTD induction was restored in the Chl-Drd2KO mice by an M1-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. In contrast, after the deletion of iMSND2Rs (iMSN-Drd2KO), LTD induction was intact in MSNs. Separate interrogation of direct pathway and iMSNs revealed a deﬁcit in LTD induction only at synapses onto iMSNs that lack D2Rs. LTD induction in iMSNs was restored by D2R agonist application. Our ﬁndings suggest that Chl D2Rs strongly modulate LTD induction in MSNs, with iMSN-D2Rs having a weaker, iMSN-speciﬁc, modulatory effect.},

Here, we show that optogenetic inhibition of CINs alleviates motor deﬁcits in PD mouse models, providing direct demonstration for their implication in parkinsonian motor dysfunctions. As neural correlates, CIN inhibition in parkinsonian mice differentially impacts the excitability of striatal D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons, normalizes pathological bursting activity in the main basal ganglia output structure, and increases the functional weight of the direct striatonigral pathway in cortical information processing. By contrast, CIN inhibition in nonlesioned mice does not affect locomotor activity, equally modulates medium spiny neuron excitability, and does not modify spontaneous or cortically driven activity in the basal ganglia output, suggesting that the role of these interneurons in motor function is highly dependent on dopamine tone.},

Several different mechanisms for pause generation have been proposed, but a unifying basis has not previously emerged. Here, using in vivo and ex vivo recordings in rat and mouse brain and a computational model, we show that ChI pauses are driven by withdrawal of excitatory inputs to striatum and result from a delayed rectiﬁer potassium current (IKr) in concert with local neuromodulation. The IKr is sensitive to Kv7.2/7.3 blocker XE-991 and enables ChIs to report changes in input, to pause on excitatory input recession, and to scale pauses with input strength, in keeping with pause acquisition during learning. We also show that although dopamine can hyperpolarize ChIs directly, its augmentation of pauses is best explained by strengthening excitatory inputs. These ﬁndings provide a basis to understand pause generation in striatal ChIs.},

Thalamostriatal neurons in the PF modulate the acquisition and performance of stimulus-response learning. Here, we address the roles of the CL thalamostriatal neurons in learning processes by using a selective neural pathway targeting technique. We show that the CL neurons are essential for the performance of stimulus-response learning and for behavioral ﬂexibility, including reversal and attentional set-shifting of learned responses. In addition, chemogenetic suppression of neural activity supports the requirements of these neurons for behavioral ﬂexibility.

Here, we used in vivo photosilencing to reveal that DLS recruitment interferes with early touchscreen discrimination learning. We also show that the direct output pathway of the DLS is preferentially recruited and causally involved in early learning and ﬁnd that silencing the normal contribution of the DLS produces plasticity-related alterations in a PL-DMS circuit. These data provide further evidence suggesting that the DLS is recruited in the construction of stimulus-elicited actions that ultimately automate behavior and liberate cognitive resources for other demands, but with a cost to performance at the outset of learning.},

Striatal CINs exhibit tonic firing punctuated by distinct pauses. Pauses occur in response to motivationally significant events, but their function is unknown. Here we investigated the effects of pauses in CIN firing on spiny projection neurons (SPNs) – the output neurons of the striatum – using in vivo whole cell and juxtacellular recordings in mice. We found that optogenetically-induced pauses in CIN firing inhibited subthreshold membrane potential activity and decreased firing of SPNs. During pauses, SPN membrane potential fluctuations became more hyperpolarized and UP state durations became shorter. In addition, short-term plasticity of corticostriatal inputs was decreased during pauses. Our results indicate that, in vivo, the net effect of the pause in CIN firing on SPNs activity is inhibition and provide a novel mechanism for cholinergic control of striatal output.
          , 
            Nerve cells or neurons communicate with one another using electrical impulses and chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. Additional molecules known as neuromodulators regulate the communication process. In contrast to neurotransmitters, neuromodulators do not send messages directly from one neuron to the next. Instead they change the way that neurons respond to neurotransmitters.
            For example, the neuromodulator acetylcholine is most abundant in a region called the striatum. Located deep within the brain, the striatum contributes to learning and memory, motivation, and movement. Studies in rodents show that neurons within the striatum called cholinergic interneurons are almost continuously active. Each time these cells fire, they release acetylcholine. But whenever an animal experiences something unusual or important, the interneurons temporarily stop firing. Zucca et al. wanted to know whether these pauses in firing also act as a signal within the striatum.
            To find out, Zucca et al. inserted a light-sensitive ion channel into cholinergic interneurons in the mouse striatum. Activating the ion channels with a laser beam stopped the interneurons from firing. Zucca et al. showed that these pauses in firing reduced the activity of another group of neurons, the spiny projection neurons. These are the major output neurons of the striatum. They send messages from the striatum to other parts of the brain. The results thus suggest that cholinergic interneurons signal notable events by temporarily blocking output from the striatum.
            Understanding how cholinergic interneurons work will help reveal how the striatum drives behavior. It may also lead to treatments for diseases caused by cholinergic system dysfunction. Many patients with Parkinson’s disease or schizophrenia take medicines to block the effects of acetylcholine. Understanding how acetylcholine affects the striatum may help clarify how these treatments work.},

	abstract = {Many theories of visual object perception assume the visual system initially extracts borders between objects and their background and then “ﬁlls in” color to the resulting object surfaces. We investigated the transformation of chromatic signals across the human ventral visual stream, with particular interest in distinguishing representations of object surface color from representations of chromatic signals reﬂecting the retinal input. We used fMRI to measure brain activity while participants viewed ﬁgure-ground stimuli that differed either in the position or in the color contrast polarity of the foreground object (the ﬁgure). Multivariate pattern analysis revealed that classiﬁers were able to decode information about which color was presented at a particular retinal location from early visual areas, whereas regions further along the ventral stream exhibited biases for representing color as part of an object’s surface, irrespective of its position on the retina. Additional analyses showed that although activity in V2 contained strong chromatic contrast information to support the early parsing of objects within a visual scene, activity in this area also signaled information about object surface color. These ﬁndings are consistent with the view that mechanisms underlying scene segmentation and the binding of color to object surfaces converge in V2.},

	abstract = {Selective attention is fundamental for human activity, but the details of its neural implementation remain elusive. One inﬂuential theory, the adaptive coding hypothesis (Duncan, 2001, An adaptive coding model of neural function in prefrontal cortex, Nature Reviews Neuroscience 2:820–829), proposes that single neurons in certain frontal and parietal regions dynamically adjust their responses to selectively encode relevant information. This selective representation may in turn support selective processing in more specialized brain regions such as the visual cortices. Here, we use multi-voxel decoding of functional magnetic resonance images to demonstrate selective representation of attended – and not distractor – objects in frontal, parietal, and visual cortices. In addition, we highlight a critical role for task demands in determining which brain regions exhibit selective coding. Strikingly, representation of attended objects in frontoparietal cortex was highest under conditions of high perceptual demand, when stimuli were hard to perceive and coding in early visual cortex was weak. Coding in early visual cortex varied as a function of attention and perceptual demand, while coding in higher visual areas was sensitive to the allocation of attention but robust to changes in perceptual difﬁculty. Consistent with highproﬁle reports, peripherally presented objects could also be decoded from activity at the occipital pole, a region which corresponds to the fovea. Our results emphasize the ﬂexibility of frontoparietal and visual systems. They support the hypothesis that attention enhances the multi-voxel representation of information in the brain, and suggest that the engagement of this attentional mechanism depends critically on current task demands.},

In many cases the optimal strategy is difﬁcult or impossible to describe verbally. Evidence suggests that success in information-integration tasks depends on procedural learning that is mediated largely within the striatum. Although many studies have examined initial information-integration learning, little is known about how automaticity develops in information-integration tasks. To address this issue, each of ten human participants received feedback training on the same informationintegration categories for more than 11,000 trials spread over 20 different training sessions. Sessions 2, 4, 10, and 20 were performed inside an MRI scanner. The following results stood out. 1) Automaticity developed between sessions 10 and 20. 2) Pre-automatic performance depended on the putamen, but not on the body and tail of the caudate nucleus. 3) Automatic performance depended only on cortical regions, particularly the supplementary and pre-supplementary motor areas. 4) Feedback processing was mainly associated with deactivations in motor and premotor regions of cortex, and in the ventral lateral prefrontal cortex. 5) The overall effects of practice were consistent with the existing literature on the development of automaticity.},

	abstract = {Use of multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to predict the cognitive state of a subject during task performance has become a popular focus of fMRI studies. The input to these analyses consists of activation patterns corresponding to different tasks or stimulus types. These activation patterns are fairly straightforward to calculate for blocked trials or slow event-related designs, but for rapid event-related designs the evoked BOLD signal for adjacent trials will overlap in time, complicating the identiﬁcation of signal unique to speciﬁc trials. Rapid event-related designs are often preferred because they allow for more stimuli to be presented and subjects tend to be more focused on the task, and thus it would be beneﬁcial to be able to use these types of designs in MVPA analyses. The present work compares 8 different models for estimating trial-by-trial activation patterns for a range of rapid event-related designs varying by interstimulus interval and signal-to-noise ratio. The most effective approach obtains each trial's estimate through a general linear model including a regressor for that trial as well as another regressor for all other trials. Through the analysis of both simulated and real data we have found that this model shows some improvement over the standard approaches for obtaining activation patterns. The resulting trial-by-trial estimates are more representative of the true activation magnitudes, leading to a boost in classiﬁcation accuracy in fast event-related designs with higher signal-to-noise. This provides the potential for fMRI studies that allow simultaneous optimization of both univariate and MVPA approaches.},

	abstract = {Despite growing interest in multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) methods for fMRI, a major problem remains —that of generating estimates in rapid event-related (ER) designs, where the BOLD responses of temporally adjacent events will overlap. While this problem has been investigated for methods that reduce each event to a single parameter per voxel (Mumford et al., 2012), most of these methods make strong parametric assumptions about the shape of the hemodynamic response, and require exact knowledge of the temporal proﬁle of the underlying neural activity. A second class of methods uses multiple parameters per event (per voxel) to capture temporal information more faithfully. In addition to enabling a more accurate estimate of ER responses, this allows for the extension of the standard classiﬁcation paradigm into the temporal domain (e.g., Mourão-Miranda et al., 2007). However, existing methods in this class were developed for use with block and slow ER data, and there has not yet been an exploration of how to adapt such methods to data collected using rapid ER designs. Here, we demonstrate that the use of multiple parameters preserves or improves classiﬁcation accuracy, while additionally providing information on the evolution of class discrimination. Additionally, we explore an alternative to the method of Mourão-Miranda et al. tailored to use in rapid ER designs that yields equivalent classiﬁcation accuracies, but is better at unmixing responses to temporally adjacent events. The current work paves the way for wider adoption of spatiotemporal classiﬁcation analyses, and greater use of MVPA with rapid ER designs.},

The present study uses multi-voxel pattern analysis to directly compare the development of automaticity in different categorization tasks. Each of the three groups of participants received extensive training in a different categorization task: either an information-integration task, or one of two rule-based tasks. Four training sessions were performed inside an MRI scanner. Three different analyses were performed on the imaging data from a number of regions of interest (ROIs). The common patterns analysis had the goal of revealing ROIs with similar patterns of activation across tasks. The unique patterns analysis had the goal of revealing ROIs with dissimilar patterns of activation across tasks. The representational similarity analysis aimed at exploring (1) the similarity of category representations across ROIs and (2) how those patterns of similarities compared across tasks. The results showed that common patterns of activation were present in motor areas and basal ganglia early in training, but only in the former later on. Unique patterns were found in a variety of cortical and subcortical areas early in training, but they were dramatically reduced with training. Finally, patterns of representational similarity between brain regions became increasingly similar across tasks with the development of automaticity.},

	abstract = {A central question in working memory research concerns the degree to which information in working memory is accessible to other cognitive processes (e.g., decision-making). Theories assuming that the focus of attention can only store a single object at a time require the focus to orient to a target representation before further processing can occur. The need to orient the focus of attention implies that single-object accounts typically predict response time costs associated with object selection even when working memory is not full (i.e., memory load is less than 4 items). For other theories that assume storage of multiple items in the focus of attention, predictions depend on specific assumptions about the way resources are allocated among items held in the focus, and how this affects the time course of retrieval of items from the focus. These broad theoretical accounts have been difficult to distinguish because conventional analyses fail to separate components of empirical response times related to decision-making from components related to selection and retrieval processes associated with accessing information in working memory. To better distinguish these response time components from one another, we analyze data from a probed visual working memory task using extensions of the diffusion decision model. Analysis of model parameters revealed that increases in memory load resulted in (a) reductions in the quality of the underlying stimulus representations in a manner consistent with a sample size model of visual working memory capacity and (b) systematic increases in the time needed to selectively access a probed representation in memory. The results are consistent with single-object theories of the focus of attention. The results are also consistent with a subset of theories that assume a multiobject focus of attention in which resource allocation diminishes both the quality and accessibility of the underlying representations.},

Activity in the accumulators increases in a linear and deterministic manner. The simplicity of the model allows complete analytic solutions for choices between any number of alternatives. These solutions (and freely-available computer code) make the model easy to apply to both binary and multiple choice situations. Using data from ﬁve previously published experiments, we demonstrate that the LBA model successfully accommodates empirical phenomena from binary and multiple choice tasks that have proven diﬃcult for other theoretical accounts. Our results are encouraging in a ﬁeld beset by the tradeoﬀ between complexity and completeness.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) models have been inﬂuential in understanding many aspects of basal ganglia function, from reward prediction to action selection. Time plays an important role in these models, but there is still no theoretical consensus about what kind of time representation is used by the basal ganglia. We review several theoretical accounts and their supporting evidence. We then discuss the relationship between RL models and the timing mechanisms that have been attributed to the basal ganglia. We hypothesize that a single computational system may underlie both RL and interval timing—the perception of duration in the range of seconds to hours. This hypothesis, which extends earlier models by incorporating a time-sensitive action selection mechanism, may have important implications for understanding disorders like Parkinson’s disease in which both decision making and timing are impaired.},

	abstract = {The cerebellar microcircuit has been the work bench for theoretical and computational modeling since the beginning of neuroscientiﬁc research. The regular neural architecture of the cerebellum inspired different solutions to the long-standing issue of how its circuitry could control motor learning and coordination. Originally, the cerebellar network was modeled using a statistical-topological approach that was later extended by considering the geometrical organization of local microcircuits. However, with the advancement in anatomical and physiological investigations, new discoveries have revealed an unexpected richness of connections, neuronal dynamics and plasticity, calling for a change in modeling strategies, so as to include the multitude of elementary aspects of the network into an integrated and easily updatable computational framework. Recently, biophysically accurate “realistic” models using a bottom-up strategy accounted for both detailed connectivity and neuronal nonlinear membrane dynamics. In this perspective review, we will consider the state of the art and discuss how these initial efforts could be further improved. Moreover, we will consider how embodied neurorobotic models including spiking cerebellar networks could help explaining the role and interplay of distributed forms of plasticity. We envisage that realistic modeling, combined with closedloop simulations, will help to capture the essence of cerebellar computations and could eventually be applied to neurological diseases and neurorobotic control systems.},

	abstract = {A fundamental challenge for systems neuroscience is to quantitatively relate its three major branches of research: brain-activity measurement, behavioral measurement, and computational modeling. Using measured brain-activity patterns to evaluate computational network models is complicated by the need to deﬁne the correspondency between the units of the model and the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g., single-cell recordings or voxels from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Similar correspondency problems complicate relating activity patterns between different modalities of brain-activity measurement (e.g., fMRI and invasive or scalp electrophysiology), and between subjects and species. In order to bridge these divides, we suggest abstracting from the activity patterns themselves and computing representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs), which characterize the information carried by a given representation in a brain or model. Building on a rich psychological and mathematical literature on similarity analysis, we propose a new experimental and data-analytical framework called representational similarity analysis (RSA), in which multi-channel measures of neural activity are quantitatively related to each other and to computational theory and behavior by comparing RDMs. We demonstrate RSA by relating representations of visual objects as measured with fMRI in early visual cortex and the fusiform face area to computational models spanning a wide range of complexities.The RDMs are simultaneously related via second-level application of multidimensional scaling and tested using randomization and bootstrap techniques. We discuss the broad potential of RSA, including novel approaches to experimental design, and argue that these ideas, which have deep roots in psychology and neuroscience, will allow the integrated quantitative analysis of data from all three branches, thus contributing to a more uniﬁed systems neuroscience.},

A key advantage of this technique over more conventional neuroimaging approaches is that model-based fMRI can provide insights into how a particular cognitive process is implemented in a specific brain area as opposed to merely identifying where a particular process is located. This review will briefly summarize the approach of model-based fMRI, with reference to the field of reward learning and decision making, where computational models have been used to probe the neural mechanisms underlying learning of reward associations, modifying action choice to obtain reward, as well as in encoding expected value signals that reflect the abstract structure of a decision problem. Finally, some of the limitations of this approach will be discussed.},

Some of these motor symptoms (e.g., deﬁcits of gait, speech, and handwriting) have similar clinical proﬁles, neural substrates, and respond similarly to dopaminergic medication and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Here, we provide an extensive review of the clinical characteristics and neural substrates of each of these motor symptoms, to highlight precisely how PD and its medical and surgical treatments impact motor symptoms. In conclusion, we offer a uniﬁed framework for understanding the range of motor symptoms in PD.

If so, mechanistic accounts are at odds with the obvious and important role of abstraction in scientiﬁc modelling. We respond to this characterization of the mechanist’s views about abstraction and articulate norms of completeness for mechanistic explanations that have no such unwanted implications.},

	abstract = {Many studies have shown that reaching movements to visual targets can rapidly adapt to altered visual feedback of hand motion (i.e., visuomotor rotation) and generalize to new target directions. This generalization is thought to reflect the acquisition of a neural representation of the novel visuomotor environment that is localized to the particular trained direction. In these studies, participants perform movements to a small number of target locations repeatedly. However, it is unclear whether adaptation and generalization are comparable when target locations are constantly varied and participants reach to visual targets one time only. Here, we compared performance for reaches to a 30° counter-clockwise visuomotor rotation to four targets, spaced 90° apart across four areas of workspace 18 times each (repeated practice (RP)) with one time only reaching movements to 72 targets, spaced 5° apart (varied practice (VP)). For both training groups, participants performed 18 reaches to radial targets (either at the repeated or varied location) in a specific area of the workspace (i.e., one of four quadrants) before reaching in the adjacent workspace. We found that the RP group adapted more completely compared to the VP group. Conversely, the VP group generalized to new target directions more completely when reaching without cursor feedback compared to the RP group. This suggests that RP and VP follow a mainly common pattern of adaptation and generalization represented in the brain, with benefits of faster adaptation with RP and more complete generalization with VP.},

	abstract = {Movement adaptation in response to systematic motor perturbations exhibits distinct spatial and temporal properties. These characteristics are typically studied in isolation, leaving the interaction largely unknown. Here we examined how the temporal decay of visuomotor adaptation influences the spatial generalization of the motor recalibration. First, we quantified the extent to which adaptation decayed over time. Subjects reached to a peripheral target, and a rotation was applied to the visual feedback of the unseen motion. The retention of this adaptation over different delays (0–120 s) 1) decreased by 29.0 ± 6.8\% at the longest delay and 2) was represented by a simple exponential, with a time constant of 22.5 ± 5.6 s. On the basis of this relationship we simulated how the spatial generalization of adaptation would change with delay. To test this directly, we trained additional subjects with the same perturbation and assessed transfer to 19 different locations (spaced 15° apart, symmetric around the trained location) and examined three delays ({\textasciitilde}4, 12, and 25 s). Consistent with the simulation, we found that generalization around the trained direction (±15°) significantly decreased with delay and distance, while locations {\textgreater}60° displayed near-constant spatiotemporal transfer. Intermediate distances (30° and 45°) showed a difference in transfer across space, but this amount was approximately constant across time. Interestingly, the decay at the trained direction was faster than that based purely on time, suggesting that the spatial transfer of adaptation is modified by concurrent passive (time dependent) and active (movement dependent) processes.
            NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Short-term motor adaptation exhibits distinct spatial and temporal characteristics. Here we investigated the interaction of these features, utilizing a simple motor adaptation paradigm (recalibration of reaching arm movements in response to rotated visual feedback). We examined the changes in the spatial generalization of motor adaptation for different temporal manipulations and report that the spatiotemporal generalization of motor adaptation is generally local and is influenced by both passive (time dependent) and active (movement dependent) learning processes.},

It is based on the assumption that the spatial structure of the distal action space is crucial for generalization. In the experiments, the distal action spaces could manifest either a symmetric or parallel structure. The imposed visuomotor rotations in the adaptation and the following generalization were either the same or opposing each other. In the generalization phase, motor bias resulting from prior adaptation was observed, and it turned out to substantially depend on the property of the workspace. In Experiment 1 with a parallel workspace, preceding adaptation to the same rotation was more advantageous than adaptation to an opposing rotation. This observation was reversed in Experiment 2 with the symmetrical workspace: prior adaptation to an opposing rotation was more advantageous for the generalization than prior adaptation to the same rotation. Mechanisms possibly underlying the observed inﬂuence of the workspace conﬁguration were discussed.},

	abstract = {Learning a motor task in one condition typically generalizes to another, although it is unclear why it generalizes substantially in certain situations, but only partially in other situations (e.g., across movement directions and motor eﬀectors). Here, we demonstrate that generalization of motor learning across directions and eﬀectors can be enhanced substantially by inducing use-dependent learning, that is, by having subjects experience motor actions associated with a desired trajectory repeatedly during reaching movements. In Experiments 1 and 2, healthy human adults adapted to a visuomotor rotation while concurrently experiencing repetitive passive movements guided by a robot. This manipulation increased the extent of generalization across movement directions (Expt. 1) and across the arms (Expt. 2) by up to 50\% and 42\%, respectively, indicating crucial contribution of use-dependent learning to motor generalization. In Experiment 3, we applied repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the left primary motor cortex (M1) of the human subjects prior to passive training with the right arm to increase cortical excitability. This intervention resulted in increased motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and decreased short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) in the rTMS group, but not in the sham group. These changes observed in the rTMS group were accompanied by enhanced generalization of visuomotor adaptation across the arms, which was not the case in the sham group. Collectively, these ﬁndings conﬁrm the involvement of M1 in use-dependent learning, and suggest that use-dependent learning can contribute not only to motor learning, but also to motor generalization.

	abstract = {The cerebellum is thought to play a critical role in procedural learning, but the relationship between this function and the underlying cellular and synaptic mechanisms remains largely speculative. At present, at least nine forms of long-term synaptic and nonsynaptic plasticity (some of which are bidirectional) have been reported in the cerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei. These include long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression at the mossy fiber–granule cell synapse, at the synapses formed by parallel fibers, climbing fibers, and molecular layer interneurons on Purkinje cells, and at the synapses formed by mossy fibers and Purkinje cells on deep cerebellar nuclear cells, as well as LTP of intrinsic excitability in granule cells, Purkinje cells, and deep cerebellar nuclear cells. It is suggested that the complex properties of cerebellar learning would emerge from the distribution of plasticity in the network and from its dynamic remodeling during the different phases of learning. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors may hold the key to explain how the different forms of plasticity cooperate to select specific transmission channels and to regulate the signal-to-noise ratio through the cerebellar cortex. These factors include regulation of neuronal excitation by local inhibitory networks, engagement of specific molecular mechanisms by spike bursts and theta-frequency oscillations, and gating by external neuromodulators. Therefore, a new and more complex view of cerebellar plasticity is emerging with respect to that predicted by the original “Motor Learning Theory,” opening issues that will require experimental and computational testing.},

	abstract = {Adaptable gain regulation is at the core of the forward controller operation performed by the cerebro-cerebellar loops and it allows the intensity of motor acts to be ﬁnely tuned in a predictive manner. In order to learn and store information about body-object dynamics and to generate an internal model of movement, the cerebellum is thought to employ long-term synaptic plasticity. LTD at the PF-PC synapse has classically been assumed to subserve this function (Marr, 1969). However, this plasticity alone cannot account for the broad dynamic ranges and time scales of cerebellar adaptation. We therefore tested the role of plasticity distributed over multiple synaptic sites (Hansel et al., 2001; Gao et al., 2012) by generating an analog cerebellar model embedded into a control loop connected to a robotic simulator. The robot used a three-joint arm and performed repetitive fast manipulations with different masses along an 8-shape trajectory. In accordance with biological evidence, the cerebellum model was endowed with both LTD and LTP at the PF-PC, MF-DCN and PC-DCN synapses. This resulted in a network scheme whose effectiveness was extended considerably compared to one including just PF-PC synaptic plasticity. Indeed, the system including distributed plasticity reliably self-adapted to manipulate different masses and to learn the arm-object dynamics over a time course that included fast learning and consolidation, along the lines of what has been observed in behavioral tests. In particular, PF-PC plasticity operated as a time correlator between the actual input state and the system error, while MF-DCN and PC-DCN plasticity played a key role in generating the gain controller. This model suggests that distributed synaptic plasticity allows generation of the complex learning properties of the cerebellum. The incorporation of further plasticity mechanisms and of spiking signal processing will allow this concept to be extended in a more realistic computational scenario.},

With this in mind, the relatively well-developed models of how the cerebellum processes information from the motor cortex might be extended to explain how it could also process information from the prefrontal cortex.},

Temporal firing patterns of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar ventral paraflocculus during ocular following responses in monkeys. I. Simple spikes. J. Neurophysiol. 80: 818–831, 1998. The simple-spike firing frequency of 30 Purkinje cells (P cells) in the ventral paraflocculus (VPFL) of alert monkeys was studied in relation to vertical slow eye movements, termed ocular following response (OFR), induced by large-field visual motions of different velocities and durations. To quantitatively analyze the relationship between eye movement and firing frequency, an inverse dynamics representation of the eye movement was used for reconstructing the temporal waveform of firing. Coefficients of eye-acceleration, velocity, and position, bias, and time lag between firing and eye movement were estimated by least-square error method. In the regression analyses for each stimulus condition, 86\% (146/170) of the well-modulated temporal firing patterns taken from those 30 P cells were reconstructed successfully from eye movement. The model with acceleration, velocity, and position terms, which we used, was shown as the best among several potential models by Cp statistics, consistent with t-test of significance of each term. Reliable coefficients were obtained from 75\% (109/146) of the well-reconstructed firing patterns of 28 cells among 30. The estimated coefficients were larger (statistically significant) for slow stimuli than for fast stimuli, suggesting changes in sensitivities under different conditions. However, firing patterns of each cell under several different conditions were frequently well reconstructed by an inverse dynamics representation with a single set of coefficients (13 cells among 21). This indicates that the relationships between P cell firing and OFR are roughly linear in those stimulus ranges. The estimated coefficients for acceleration and velocity suggested that the VPFL P cells properly encode the dynamic components of the motor command during vertical OFR. As for the positional component, however, these P cells are correlated with eye movement in the opposite direction. In the regression analysis without positional component, remarkable differences between observed and reconstructed firing patterns were noted especially in the initial phase of the movements, indicating that the negative positional component was not negligible during OFR. Thus we conclude that, during OFR, the VPFL P cells cannot provide the necessary final motor command, and other brain regions, downstream neural structures, or other types of P cells must provide lacking position-dependent motor commands. This finding about the negative correlation with the position is in the opposite sign with previous studies obtained from the fixation and the smooth pursuit movement. From these comparisons, how the VPFL contributes to a part of the final motor command or how other brain regions complement the VPFL is suggested to be different for early and late phases of the movements.},

Temporal firing patterns of Purkinje cells in cerebellar ventral paraflocculus during ocular following responses in monkeys. II. Complex spikes. J. Neurophysiol. 80: 832–848, 1998. Many theories of cerebellar motor learning propose that complex spikes (CS) provide essential error signals for learning and modulate parallel fiber inputs that generate simple spikes (SS). These theories, however, do not satisfactorily specify what modality is represented by CS or how information is conveyed by the ultra-low CS firing rate (1 Hz). To further examine the function of CS and the relationship between CS and SS in the cerebellum, CS and SS were recorded in the ventral paraflocculus (VPFL) of awake monkeys during ocular following responses (OFR). In addition, a new statistical method using a generalized linear model of firing probability based on a binomial distribution of the spike count was developed for analysis of the ultra-low CS firing rate. The results of the present study showed that the spatial coordinates of CS were aligned with those of SS and the speed-tuning properties of CS and SS were more linear for eye movement than retinal slip velocity, indicating that CS contain a motor component in addition to the sensory component identified in previous studies. The generalized linear model to reproduce firing probability confirmed these results, demonstrating that CS conveyed high-frequency information with its ultra-low firing frequency and conveyed both sensory and motor information. Although the temporal patterns of the CS were similar to those of the SS when the sign was reversed and magnitude was amplified ∼50 times, the velocity/acceleration coefficient ratio of the eye movement model, an aspect of the CS temporal firing profile, was less than that of the SS, suggesting that CS were more sensory in nature than SS. A cross-correlation analysis of SS that are triggered by CS revealed that short-term modulation, that is, the brief pause in SS caused by CS, does not account for the reciprocal modulation of SS and CS. The results also showed that three major aspects of the CS and SS individual cell firing characteristics were negatively correlated on a cell-to-cell basis: the preferred direction of stimulus motion, the mean percent change in firing rate induced by upward stimulus motion, and patterns of temporal firing probability. These results suggest that CS may contribute to long-term interactions between parallel and climbing fiber inputs, such as long-term depression and/or potentiation.},

	abstract = {There is mounting evidence for the idea that performance in a visuomotor rotation task can be supported by both implicit and explicit forms of learning. The implicit component of learning has been well characterized in previous experiments and is thought to arise from the adaptation of an internal model driven by sensorimotor prediction errors. However, the role of explicit learning is less clear, and previous investigations aimed at characterizing the explicit component have relied on indirect measures such as dual-task manipulations, posttests, and descriptive computational models. To address this problem, we developed a new method for directly assaying explicit learning by having participants verbally report their intended aiming direction on each trial. While our previous research employing this method has demonstrated the possibility of measuring explicit learning over the course of training, it was only tested over a limited scope of manipulations common to visuomotor rotation tasks. In the present study, we sought to better characterize explicit and implicit learning over a wider range of task conditions. We tested how explicit and implicit learning change as a function of the specific visual landmarks used to probe explicit learning, the number of training targets, and the size of the rotation. We found that explicit learning was remarkably flexible, responding appropriately to task demands. In contrast, implicit learning was strikingly rigid, with each task condition producing a similar degree of implicit learning. These results suggest that explicit learning is a fundamental component of motor learning and has been overlooked or conflated in previous visuomotor tasks.},

	abstract = {Generalization is a fundamental aspect of behavior, allowing for the transfer of knowledge from one context to another. The details of this transfer are thought to reveal how the brain represents what it learns. Generalization has been a central focus in studies of sensorimotor adaptation, and its pattern has been well characterized: Learning of new dynamic and kinematic transformations in one region of space tapers off in a Gaussian-like fashion to neighboring untrained regions, echoing tuned population codes in the brain. In contrast to common allusions to generalization in cognitive science, generalization in visually guided reaching is usually framed as a passive consequence of neural tuning functions rather than a cognitive feature of learning. While previous research has presumed that maximum generalization occurs at the instructed task goal or the actual movement direction, recent work suggests that maximum generalization may occur at the location of an explicitly accessible movement plan. Here we provide further support for plan-based generalization, formalize this theory in an updated model of adaptation, and test several unexpected implications of the model. First, we employ a generalization paradigm to parameterize the generalization function and ascertain its maximum point. We then apply the derived generalization function to our model and successfully simulate and fit the time course of implicit adaptation across three behavioral experiments. We find that dynamics predicted by plan-based generalization are borne out in the data, are contrary to what traditional models predict, and lead to surprising implications for the behavioral, computational, and neural characteristics of sensorimotor adaptation.
            NEW \& NOTEWORTHY The pattern of generalization is thought to reveal how the motor system represents learned actions. Recent work has made the intriguing suggestion that maximum generalization in sensorimotor adaptation tasks occurs at the location of the learned movement plan. Here we support this interpretation, develop a novel model of motor adaptation that incorporates plan-based generalization, and use the model to successfully predict surprising dynamics in the time course of adaptation across several conditions.},

	abstract = {Generalization provides a window into the representational changes that occur during motor learning. Neural network models have been integral in revealing how the neural representation constrains the extent of generalization. Specifically, two key features are thought to define the pattern of generalization. First, generalization is constrained by the properties of the underlying neural units; with directionally tuned units, the extent of generalization is limited by the width of the tuning functions. Second, error signals are used to update a sensorimotor map to align the desired and actual output, with a gradient-descent learning rule ensuring that the error produces changes in those units responsible for the error. In prior studies, task-specific effects in generalization have been attributed to differences in neural tuning functions. Here we ask whether differences in generalization functions may arise from task-specific error signals. We systematically varied visual error information in a visuomotor adaptation task and found that this manipulation led to qualitative differences in generalization. A neural network model suggests that these differences are the result of error feedback processing operating on a homogeneous and invariant set of tuning functions. Consistent with novel predictions derived from the model, increasing the number of training directions led to specific distortions of the generalization function. Taken together, the behavioral and modeling results offer a parsimonious account of generalization that is based on the utilization of feedback information to update a sensorimotor map with stable tuning functions.},

	abstract = {In daily life, people are constantly presented with situations in which they have to learn and acquire new motor skills in complex environments, where attention is often distracted by other events. Being able to generalize and perform the acquired motor action in different environments is a crucial part of visuomotor learning. The current study examined whether attentional distraction impairs generalization of visuomotor adaptation or whether consistent distraction can operate as an internal cue to facilitate generalization. Using a dual-task paradigm combining visuomotor rotational adaptation and an attention-demanding secondary task, we showed that switching the attentional context from training (dual-task) to generalization (single-task) reduced the range of transfer of visuomotor adaptation to untrained directions. However, when consistent distraction was present throughout training and generalization, visuomotor generalization was equivalent to without distractions at all. Furthermore, this attentional context-dependent generalization was evident even when sensory modality of distractions differed between training and generalization. Therefore, the general nature of the dual tasks, rather than the specific stimuli, is associated with visuomotor memory and serves as a critical cue for generalization. Taken together, we demonstrated that attention plays a critical role during sensorimotor adaptation in selecting and associating multisensory signals with motor memory. This finding provides insight into developing learning programs that are generalizable in complex daily environments.
            NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Learning novel motor actions in complex environments with attentional distraction is a critical function. Successful motor learning involves the ability to transfer the acquired skill from the trained to novel environments. Here, we demonstrate attentional distraction does not impair visuomotor adaptation. Rather, consistency in the attentional context from training to generalization modulates the degree of transfer to untrained locations. The role of attention and memory must, therefore, be incorporated into existing models of visuomotor learning.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ergonomic assessment of the instrument to needle to tissue relationship on efﬁciency and accuracy of laparoscopic suturing.
METHODS: Video records of nine laparoscopic surgeons were analyzed for ﬁve technical variables of laparoscopic suturing. Surgeons undertook closure of 60 mm enterotomy using continuous 3/0 seromuscular atraumatic sutures. Subjects attempted to suture 3 to 5 mm from enterotomy edge and at 3 to 5 mm intervals. Vertical/horizontal deviations from desired entry/exit point of suture, execution time, and failure to complete sutures were recorded.
RESULTS: Visualization style used by some was signiﬁcantly more accurate but slower than the nonvisualization style used by others. Needle insertion angle of 80° to 100° gripping the middle and proximal end of needle and holding the needle {\textgreater}90° to instrument axis signiﬁcantly improved task accuracy. Insertion angle {\textless}80° produced three times the failure rate of 80° to 100°. Surgeon’s performance was consistent with either suturing style.
CONCLUSIONS: Visualization style was slower but more accurate. Optimum conditions for good suturing include 80° to 100° needle insertion angle; holding angle {\textgreater}90°, and gripping point at middle and proximal third of the shaft of the needle.},

We define an extrinsic frame of reference to represent the location of a point in extrapersonal space relative to a human subject's shoulder, and we define an intrinsic frame of reference to represent the orientation of the arm and forearm. 2. We examined the relations between coordinates in the extrinsic and intrinsic frames of reference under two experimental conditions: when subjects made inaccurate movements by pointing to virtual targets in the dark and when they made accurate movements by pointing to actual targets in the light. 3. When subjects made inaccurate movements, there was a close-to-linear relationship between the orientation angles of the arm (intrinsic coordinates) at its final position and the extrinsic coordinates of the target. When they made accurate movements, these relationships were more nonlinear. 4. Specifically, arm and forearm elevations depended principally on target distance and elevation, whereas the two yaw angles depended mainly on the target's azimuth. 5. We propose that errors in pointing occur because subjects implement a linear approximation to the transformation from extrinsic to intrinsic coordinates and that this transformation is one step in the process of transforming a visually derived representation of target location into an appropriate pattern of muscle activity.},

	abstract = {Synaptic plasticity, the activity-dependent change in neuronal connection strength, has long been considered an important component of learning and memory. Computational and engineering work corroborate the power of learning through the directed adjustment of connection weights. Here we review the fundamental elements of four broadly categorized forms of synaptic plasticity and discuss their functional capabilities and limitations. Although standard, correlation-based, Hebbian synaptic plasticity has been the primary focus of neuroscientists for decades, it is inherently limited. Three-factor plasticity rules supplement Hebbian forms with neuromodulation and eligibility traces, while true supervised types go even further by adding objectives and instructive signals. Finally, a recently discovered hippocampal form of synaptic plasticity combines the above elements, while leaving behind the primary Hebbian requirement. We suggest that the effort to determine the neural basis of adaptive behavior could benefit from renewed experimental and theoretical investigation of more powerful directed types of synaptic plasticity.

In contrast, we report that synaptic plasticity can itself be precisely tuned to the requirements of a learning task. We found that the rules for induction of long-term and single-trial plasticity at parallel ﬁber-to-Purkinje cell synapses vary across cerebellar regions. In the ﬂocculus, associative plasticity in vitro and in vivo is narrowly tuned for an interval of \$120 ms, which compensates for the speciﬁc processing delay for error signals to reach the ﬂocculus during oculomotor learning. In the vermis, which supports a range of behavioral functions, plasticity is induced by a range of intervals, with individual cells tuned for different intervals. Thus, plasticity at a single, anatomically deﬁned type of synapse can have properties that vary in a way that is precisely matched to function.},

Numerous studies documenting cognitive deﬁcits of PD patients have revealed impairments in a variety of tasks related to memory, learning, visuospatial skills, and attention. While there have been several studies documenting cognitive deﬁcits of PD patients, very few computational models have been proposed. In this article, we use the COVIS model of category learning to simulate DA depletion and show that the model suffers from cognitive symptoms similar to those of human participants affected by PD. Speciﬁcally, DA depletion in COVIS produced deﬁcits in rule-based categorization, non-linear information-integration categorization, probabilistic classiﬁcation, rule maintenance, and rule switching. These were observed by simulating results from younger controls, older controls, PD patients, and severe PD patients in ﬁve well-known tasks. Differential performance among the different age groups and clinical populations was modeled simply by changing the amount of DA available in the model. This suggests that COVIS may not only be an adequate model of the simulated tasks and phenomena but also more generally of the role of DA in these tasks and phenomena.},

Herein, we discuss the involvement of cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) in striatally-mediated movement in a healthy, parkinsonian, and dyskinetic state. ChIs integrate numerous neurotransmitter signals using intrinsic glutamate, serotonin, and DA receptors and convey the appropriate transmission onto nearby muscarinic and nicotinic ACh receptors to produce movement. In PD, severe DA depletion causes abnormal rises in ChI activity which promote striatal signaling to attenuate normal movement. When treating PD with L-DOPA, hyperkinetic side eﬀects, or LID, develop due to increased striatal DA; however, the role of ChIs and ACh transmission, until recently has been unclear. Fortunately, new technology and pharmacological agents have facilitated understanding of ChI function and ACh signaling in the context of LID, thus oﬀering new opportunities to modify existing and discover future therapeutic strategies in movement disorders.},

Some of these motor symptoms (e.g., deﬁcits of gait, speech, and handwriting) have similar clinical proﬁles, neural substrates, and respond similarly to dopaminergic medication and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Here, we provide an extensive review of the clinical characteristics and neural substrates of each of these motor symptoms, to highlight precisely how PD and its medical and surgical treatments impact motor symptoms. In conclusion, we offer a uniﬁed framework for understanding the range of motor symptoms in PD.

This creates an imbalance between dopaminergic inputs and cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) within the striatum. The eﬃcacy of anticholinergic drugs, one of the earliest therapy for PD before the discovery of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) suggests an increased cholinergic tone in this disease. The dopamine (DA)-acetylcholine (ACh) balance hypothesis is now revisited with the use of novel cutting-edge techniques (optogenetics, pharmacogenetics, new electrophysiological recordings). This review will provide the background of the speciﬁc contribution of ChIs to striatal microcircuit organization in physiological and pathological conditions. The second goal of this review is to delve into the respective contributions of nicotinic and muscarinic receptor cholinergic subunits to the control of striatal aﬀerent and eﬀerent neuronal systems. Special attention will be given to the role played by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in the regulation of striatal network which may have important implications in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for motor and cognitive impairment in PD.},

	abstract = {Disruption to different components of the prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and hippocampal circuits leads to various psychiatric and neurological disorders including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and schizophrenia. Medications used to treat these disorders (such as levodopa, dopamine agonists, antipsychotics, among others) affect the prefrontal-striatal-hippocampal circuits in a complex fashion. We have built models of prefrontal-striatal and striatal-hippocampal interactions which simulate cognitive dysfunction in PD and schizophrenia. In these models, we argue that the basal ganglia is key for stimulus-response learning, the hippocampus for stimulus-stimulus representational learning, and the prefrontal cortex for stimulus selection during learning about multidimensional stimuli. In our models, PD is associated with reduced dopamine levels in the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex. In contrast, the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are associated primarily with hippocampal dysfunction, while the occurrence of negative symptoms is associated with frontostriatal deficits in a subset of patients. In this paper, we review our past models and provide new simulation results for both PD and schizophrenia. We also describe an extended model that includes simulation of the different functional role of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex, a dissociation we argue is essential for understanding the nonuniform effects of levodopa, dopamine agonists, and antipsychotics on cognition. Motivated by clinical and physiological data, we discuss model limitations and challenges to be addressed in future models of these brain disorders.},

	abstract = {Cools (2006) suggested that prefrontal dopamine levels are related to cognitive stability whereas striatal dopamine levels are related to cognitive plasticity. With such a wide ranging role, almost all cognitive activities should be affected by dopamine levels in the brain. Not surprisingly, factors influencing brain dopamine levels have been shown to improve/worsen performance in many behavioral experiments. On the one hand, Nadler, Rabi, and Minda (2010) showed that positive affect (which is thought to increase cortical dopamine levels) improves a type of categorization that depends on explicit reasoning (rule-based) but not another type that depends on procedural learning (information-integration). On the other hand, Parkinson’s disease (which is known to decrease dopamine levels in both the striatum and cortex) produces proactive interference in the odd-man-out task (Flowers \& Robertson, 1985) and renders subjects insensitive to negative feedback during reversal learning (Cools, Altamirano, \& D’Esposito, 2006). This article uses the COVIS model of categorization to simulate the effects of different dopamine levels in categorization, reversal learning, and the odd-man-out task. The results show a good match between the simulated and human data, which suggests that the role of dopamine in COVIS can account for several cognitive enhancements and deficits related to dopamine levels in healthy and patient populations.},

To determine the role of the PFn in striatal PD pathophysiology, optogenetic, chemogenetic, and electrophysiological tools were used in ex vivo slices from transgenic mice with regionspeciﬁc Cre recombinase expression. These studies revealed that in parkinsonian mice, the functional connectivity of PFn neurons with indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs) was selectively enhanced by cholinergic interneurons acting through presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on PFn terminals. Attenuating this network adaptation by chemogenetic or genetic strategies alleviated motor-learning deﬁcits in parkinsonian mice, pointing to a potential new therapeutic strategy for PD patients.},

Deletion of Chl-D2Rs (Chl-Drd2KO) impaired LTD induction in both subtypes of MSNs. LTD induction was restored in the Chl-Drd2KO mice by an M1-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. In contrast, after the deletion of iMSND2Rs (iMSN-Drd2KO), LTD induction was intact in MSNs. Separate interrogation of direct pathway and iMSNs revealed a deﬁcit in LTD induction only at synapses onto iMSNs that lack D2Rs. LTD induction in iMSNs was restored by D2R agonist application. Our ﬁndings suggest that Chl D2Rs strongly modulate LTD induction in MSNs, with iMSN-D2Rs having a weaker, iMSN-speciﬁc, modulatory effect.},

by having patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and matched 
controls solve categorization problems in which the optimal 
rule was linear or nonlinear using the perceptual categorization 
task. Traditional accuracy-based analyses, as well as quantitative 
model-based analyses were performed. Unlike accuracy-based 
analyses, the model-based analyses allow one to quantify and 
separate the effects of categorization rule learning from 
variability in the trial-by-trial application of the 
participant's rule. When the categorization rule was linear, 
PD patients showed no accuracy, categorization rule learning, 
or rule application variability deficits. Categorization accuracy 
for the PD patients was associated with their performance on 
a test believed to be sensitive to frontal lobe functioning. 
In contrast, when the categorization rule was nonlinear, the 
PD patients showed accuracy, categorization rule learning, and 
rule application variability deficits. Furthermore, categorization 
accuracy was not associated with performance on the test of 
frontal lobe functioning. Implications for neuropsychological 
theories of categorization learning are discussed. (

TANs pause their tonic ﬁring activity after excitatory stimuli from thalamic and cortical neurons in response to a sensory event or reward information. During the pause striatal dopamine concentration excursions are observed. However, functional interactions between the TAN pause and striatal dopamine release are poorly understood. Here we propose a TAN activity-dopamine relationship model and demonstrate that the TAN pause is likely a time window to gate phasic dopamine release and dopamine variations reciprocally modulate the TAN pause duration. Furthermore, this model is integrated into our previously published model of reward-based motor adaptation to demonstrate how phasic dopamine release is gated by the TAN pause to deliver reward information for reinforcement learning in a timely manner. We also show how TANdopamine interactions are affected by striatal dopamine deﬁciency to produce poor performance of motor adaptation.},

	abstract = {We continuously face the dilemma of choosing between actions that gather new information or actions that exploit existing knowledge. This “exploration-exploitation” trade-off depends on the environment: stability favors exploiting knowledge to maximize gains; volatility favors exploring new options and discovering new outcomes. Here we set out to reconcile recent evidence for dopamine’s involvement in the exploration-exploitation trade-off with the existing evidence for basal ganglia control of action selection, by testing the hypothesis that tonic dopamine in the striatum, the basal ganglia’s input nucleus, sets the current exploration-exploitation trade-off. We ﬁrst advance the idea of interpreting the basal ganglia output as a probability distribution function for action selection. Using computational models of the full basal ganglia circuit, we showed that, under this interpretation, the actions of dopamine within the striatum change the basal ganglia’s output to favor the level of exploration or exploitation encoded in the probability distribution. We also found that our models predict striatal dopamine controls the exploration-exploitation trade-off if we instead read-out the probability distribution from the target nuclei of the basal ganglia, where their inhibitory input shapes the cortical input to these nuclei. Finally, by integrating the basal ganglia within a reinforcement learning model, we showed how dopamine’s effect on the exploration-exploitation trade-off could be measurable in a forced two-choice task. These simulations also showed how tonic dopamine can appear to affect learning while only directly altering the trade-off. Thus, our models support the hypothesis that changes in tonic dopamine within the striatum can alter the exploration-exploitation trade-off by modulating the output of the basal ganglia.},

	abstract = {Objective—Numerous studies documenting cognitive deficits in Parkinson’s disease (PD) revealed impairment in a variety of tasks related to memory, learning, and attention. One ubiquitous task that has not received much attention, is categorization system–switching. Categorization system–switching is a form of task–switching requiring participants to switch between different categorization systems. In this article, we explore whether older adults and people with PD show deficits in categorization system–switching.
Method—Twenty older adults diagnosed with PD, 20 neurologically intact older adults, and 67 young adults participated in this study. Participants were first trained in rule–based (RB) and later information–integration (II) categorization separately. After training on the tasks, participants performed a block of trial–by–trial switching where the RB and II trials randomly intermixed. Finally, the last block of trials also intermixed RB and II trials randomly but additionally changed the location of the response buttons.
Results—Contrary to our hypothesis, the results show no difference in accuracy between older adults and people with PD during the intermixed trial block, as well as no difference in response time (RT) switch cost. However, both groups were less accurate during intermixed trial blocks and had a higher RT switch cost when compared to young adults. In addition, the proportion of participants able to switch systems was smaller in people with PD than in young adults.
Conclusions—The results suggest that older adults and people with PD have impaired categorization system–switching ability, and that this ability may be related to a decrease in tonic dopamine (DA) levels associated with normal aging and PD.},

The eﬃcacy of anticholinergic drugs, one of the earliest therapy for PD before the discovery of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) suggests an increased cholinergic tone in this disease.

This review will provide the background of the speciﬁc contribution of ChIs to striatal microcircuit organization in physiological and pathological conditions.

While thalamic inputs provide strong excitatory input to ChIs, cortical inputs primarily regulate MSN ﬁring. Here, we found that, while thalamic inputs do drive ChI ﬁring, a subset of ChIs responds robustly to stimulation of cortical inputs as well. To examine how input-evoked changes in ChI ﬁring patterns drive acetylcholine release at cholinergic synapses onto MSNs, muscarinic M4-receptormediated synaptic events were measured in MSNs overexpressing G-protein gated potassium channels (GIRK2). Stimulation of both cortical and thalamic inputs was sufﬁcient to equally drive muscarinic synaptic events in MSNs, resulting from the broad synaptic innervation of the stimulus-activated ChI population across many MSNs. Taken together, this indicates an underappreciated role for the extensive cholinergic network, in which small populations of ChIs can drive substantial changes in post-synaptic receptor activity across the striatum.},

Using Slc6a3DTR/+ diphtheria-toxin-sensitive mice, we demonstrate that a progressive and L-dopa-responsive DA deﬁciency reduces ACh availability and the transcription of hyperpolarization-activated cation (HCN) channels that encode the spike timing of ACh-releasing tonically active striatal interneurons (ChIs). Although the production and release of ACh and DA are reduced, the preponderance of ACh over DA contributes to the motor deﬁcit. The increase in striatal ACh relative to DA is heightened via D1-type DA receptors that activate ChIs in response to DA release from residual axons. These results suggest that stabilizing the expression of HCN channels may improve ACh-DA reciprocity and motor function in Parkinson’s disease (PD).},

To examine the dynamics of acetylcholine release, we used optogenetics and paired recordings from CHIs and medium spiny neurons (MSNs) virally overexpressing G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. Due to the efﬁcient coupling between endogenous muscarinic receptors and GIRK channels, we found that ﬁring of individual CHIs resulted in monosynaptic spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) in MSNs. Paired CHIMSN recordings revealed that the high probability of acetylcholine release at these synapses allowed muscarinic receptors to faithfully encode physiological activity patterns from individual CHIs without failure.

This attentional shift is thought to rely upon thalamic signals to the striatum to shift cortically driven action selection, but the network mechanisms underlying this interaction are unclear. Using a brain slice preparation that preserved cortico- and thalamostriatal connectivity, it was found that activation of thalamostriatal axons in a way that mimicked the response to salient stimuli induced a burst of spikes in striatal cholinergic interneurons that was followed by a pause lasting more than half a second. This patterned interneuron activity triggered a transient, presynaptic suppression of cortical input to both major classes of principal medium spiny neuron (MSN) that gave way to a prolonged enhancement of postsynaptic responsiveness in striatopallidal MSNs controlling motor suppression. This differential regulation of the corticostriatal circuitry provides a neural substrate for attentional shifts and cessation of ongoing motor activity with the appearance of salient environmental stimuli.},

In a changing environment, plasticity has to remain ﬂexible, requiring interference between new and existing learning to be minimized, yet it is not known how new and existing learning are interlaced in this way. Here we investigated the role of the thalamostriatal pathway linking the parafascicular thalamus (Pf) with cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the pDMS in this process. Removing the excitatory input from Pf to the CINs was found to reduce the ﬁring rate and intrinsic activity of these neurons and produced an enduring deﬁcit in goal-directed learning after changes in the action-outcome contingency. Disconnection of the Pf-pDMS pathway produced similar behavioral effects. These data suggest that CINs reduce interference between new and existing learning, consistent with claims that the thalamostriatal pathway exerts state control over learning-related plasticity.},

Of late, direct D1R-D3R interactions have been linked to LID yet remain enigmatic. Therefore, the current research sought to characterize consequences of putative D1R-D3R interactions in dyskinesia expression and in LID-associated downstream cellular signaling. To do so, adult male Sprague-Dawley hemi-parkinsonian rats were given daily L-DOPA (6 mg/kg; s.c.) for 2 weeks to establish stable LID, as measured via the abnormal voluntary movements (AIMs) scale. Thereafter, rats underwent dose-response AIMs testing for the D1R agonist SKF38393 (0, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 mg/kg) and the D3R agonist, PD128907 (0, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 mg/kg). Each agonist dose-dependently induced dyskinesia, implicating individual receptor involvement. More importantly, when threshold doses were co-administered, rats displayed synergistic exacerbation of dyskinesia. Interestingly, this observation was not mirrored in general locomotor behaviors, highlighting a potentially dyskinesia-speciﬁc effect. To illuminate the mechanisms by which D1R-D3R co-stimulation led to in vivo synergy, levels of striatal phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2) were quantiﬁed after administration of SKF38393 and/or PD128907. Combined agonist treatment synergistically drove striatal pERK1/2 expression. Together, these results support the presence of a functional, synergistic interaction between D1R and D3R that manifests both behaviorally and biochemically to drive dyskinesia in hemi-parkinsonian rats.},

In addition, whether D1 and D2 receptors located in the substantia nigra reticulata shape the response to levodopa remains unknown. We therefore used dual probe microdialysis to unravel the impact of striatal and nigral D1 or D2 receptor blockade on abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) and striatal output pathways in unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned dyskinetic rats. Regional perfusion of D1/D5 (SCH23390) and D2/D3 (raclopride) receptor antagonists was combined with systemic administration of levodopa. Levodopa-induced AIMs coincided with a prolonged surge of GABA and glutamate levels in the substantia nigra reticulata. Intrastriatal SCH23390 attenuated the levodopa-induced AIM scores ({\textasciitilde}50\%) and prevented the accompanying neurochemical response whereas raclopride was ineffective. When perfused in the substantia nigra, both antagonists attenuated AIM expression ({\textasciitilde}21–40\%). However, only intranigral SCH23390 attenuated levodopa-induced nigral GABA efﬂux, whereas raclopride reduced basal GABA levels without affecting the response to levodopa. In addition, intranigral raclopride elevated amino acid release in the striatum and revealed a (mild) facilitatory effect of levodopa on striatal glutamate. We conclude that both striatal and nigral D1 receptors play an important role in dyskinesia possibly via modulation of the striato-nigral direct pathway. In addition, the stimulation of nigral D2 receptors contributes to dyskinesia while modulating glutamate and GABA efﬂux both locally and in the striatum.},

Emerging evidence indicates that the nicotinic cholinergic system plays a role in LIDs, although the pathways and mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we used optogenetics to investigate the role of striatal cholinergic interneurons in LIDs. Mice expressing cre-recombinase under the control of the choline acetyltransferase promoter (ChAT-Cre) were lesioned by unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine. AAV5-ChR2-eYFP or AAV5control-eYFP was injected into the dorsolateral striatum, and optical ﬁbers implanted. After stable virus expression, mice were treated with L-dopa. They were then subjected to various stimulation protocols for 2 h and LIDs rated. Continuous stimulation with a short duration optical pulse (1–5 ms) enhanced LIDs. This effect was blocked by the general muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonist atropine indicating it was mAChR-mediated. By contrast, continuous stimulation with a longer duration optical pulse (20 ms to 1 s) reduced LIDs to a similar extent as nicotine treatment ({\textasciitilde} 50\%). The general nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist mecamylamine blocked the decline in LIDs with longer optical pulses showing it was nAChR-mediated. None of the stimulation regimens altered LIDs in control-eYFP mice. Lesion-induced motor impairment was not affected by optical stimulation indicating that cholinergic transmission selectively regulates LIDs. Longer pulse stimulation increased the number of c-Fos expressing ChAT neurons, suggesting that changes in this immediate early gene may be involved. These results demonstrate that striatal cholinergic interneurons play a critical role in LIDs and support the idea that nicotine treatment reduces LIDs via nAChR desensitization. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The brain cholinergic system is basically constituted by three populations of phenotypically similar neurons forming a series of basal forebrain nuclei, the midpontine nuclei and a large population of striatal interneurons. In Alzheimer’s disease there is an extensive loss of forebrain cholinergic neurons accompanied by a reduction of the cholinergic ﬁber network of the cortical mantel and hippocampus. The midpontine cholinergic nuclei are spared. The same situation occurs in the corticobasal syndrome and dementia following alcohol abuse and traumatic brain injury. Conversely, in Parkinson’s disease, the midpontine nuclei degenerate, together with the dopaminergic nuclei, reducing the cholinergic input to thalamus and forebrain whereas the forebrain cholinergic neurons are spared. In Parkinson’s disease with dementia, Lewis Body Dementia and Parkinsonian syndromes both groups of forebrain and midpontine cholinergic nuclei degenerate. In Huntington’s disease a dysfunction of the striatal cholinergic interneurons without cell loss takes place. The formation and accumulation of misfolded proteins such as b-amyloid oligomers and plaques, tau protein tangles and a-synuclein clumps, and aggregated mutated huntingtin play a crucial role in the neuronal degeneration by direct cellular toxicity of the misfolded proteins and through the toxic compounds resulting from an extensive inﬂammatory reaction. Evidences indicate that b-amyloid disrupts NGF metabolism causing the degeneration of the cholinergic neurons which depend on NGF for their survival, namely the forebrain cholinergic neurons, sparing the midpontine and striatal neurons which express no speciﬁc NGF receptors. It is feasible that the latter cholinergic neurons may be damaged by direct toxicity of tau, a-synuclein and inﬂammations products through mechanisms not fully understood. Attention and learning and memory impairment are the functional consequences of the forebrain cholinergic neuron dysfunction, whereas the loss of midpontine cholinergic neurons results primarily in motor and sleep disturbances.},

Although the reciprocal balance of dopamine and acetylcholine in the striatum is well known, how dopamine neurons control cholinergic neurons has not been elucidated. Here, we show that dopamine neurons make direct fast dopaminergic and glutamatergic connections with cholinergic interneurons, with regional heterogeneity. Dopamine neurons drive a burst-pause ﬁring sequence in cholinergic interneurons in the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens, mixed actions in the accumbens core, and a pause in the dorsal striatum. This heterogeneity is due mainly to regional variation in dopamine-neuron glutamate cotransmission. A single dose of amphetamine attenuates dopamine neuron connections to cholinergic interneurons with dose-dependent regional speciﬁcity. Overall, the present data indicate that dopamine neurons control striatal circuit function via discrete, plastic connections with cholinergic interneurons.},

Here we report that extracellular DA increases induced by selective optogenetic activation of cholinergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are inhibited by CB1 agonists and eCBs. This modulation requires CB1 receptors on cortical glutamatergic afferents. Dopamine increases driven by optogenetic activation of prefrontal cortex (PFC) terminals in the NAc are similarly modulated by activation of these CB1 receptors. We further demonstrate that this same population of CB1 receptors modulates optical self-stimulation sustained by activation of PFC afferents in the NAc.

The IKr is sensitive to Kv7.2/7.3 blocker XE-991 and enables ChIs to report changes in input, to pause on excitatory input recession, and to scale pauses with input strength, in keeping with pause acquisition during learning. We also show that although dopamine can hyperpolarize ChIs directly, its augmentation of pauses is best explained by strengthening excitatory inputs.

To understand dopamine function, much attention has focused on how midbrain dopamine neurons modulate their ﬁring patterns. However, we identify a presynaptic mechanism that triggers dopamine release directly, bypassing activity in dopamine neurons. We paired electrophysiological recordings of striatal channelrhodopsin2-expressing cholinergic interneurons with simultaneous detection of dopamine release at carbon-ﬁber microelectrodes in striatal slices. We reveal that activation of cholinergic interneurons by light ﬂashes that cause only single action potentials in neurons from a small population triggers dopamine release via activation of nicotinic receptors on dopamine axons. This event overrides ascending activity from dopamine neurons and, furthermore, is reproduced by activating ChR2-expressing thalamostriatal inputs, which synchronize cholinergic interneurons in vivo. These ﬁndings indicate that synchronized activity in cholinergic interneurons directly generates striatal dopamine signals whose functions will extend beyond those encoded by dopamine neuron activity.},

This patterned interneuron activity triggered a transient, presynaptic suppression of cortical input to both major classes of principal medium spiny neuron (MSN) that gave way to a prolonged enhancement of postsynaptic responsiveness in striatopallidal MSNs controlling motor suppression. This differential regulation of the corticostriatal circuitry provides a neural substrate for attentional shifts and cessation of ongoing motor activity with the appearance of salient environmental stimuli.},

In a changing environment, plasticity has to remain ﬂexible, requiring interference between new and existing learning to be minimized, yet it is not known how new and existing learning are interlaced in this way. Here we investigated the role of the thalamostriatal pathway linking the parafascicular thalamus (Pf) with cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the pDMS in this process. Removing the excitatory input from Pf to the CINs was found to reduce the ﬁring rate and intrinsic activity of these neurons and produced an enduring deﬁcit in goal-directed learning after changes in the action-outcome contingency. Disconnection of the Pf-pDMS pathway produced similar behavioral effects. These data suggest that CINs reduce interference between new and existing learning, consistent with claims that the thalamostriatal pathway exerts state control over learning-related plasticity.},

	abstract = {The cerebellum is strongly implicated in learning new motor skills. Theta burst stimulation (TBS), a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, can be used to inﬂuence cerebellar activity. Our aim was to explore the potential of cerebellar TBS in modulating visuo-motor adaptation, a form of motor learning, in young healthy subjects. Cerebellar TBS was applied immediately before the learning phase of a visuo-motor adaptation task (VAT), in two different experiments. Firstly, we evaluated the behavioral effects of continuous (cTBS), intermittent (iTBS) or sham TBS on the learning, re-adaptation and de-adaptation phases of VAT. Subsequently, we investigated the changes induced by iTBS or sham TBS on motor cortical activity related to each phase of VAT, as measured by concomitant TMS/EEG recordings. We found that cerebellar TBS induced a robust bidirectional modulation of the VAT performance. More speciﬁcally, cerebellar iTBS accelerated visuo-motor adaptation, by speeding up error reduction in response to a novel perturbation. This gain of function was still maintained when the novel acquired motor plan was tested during a subsequent phase of re-adaptation. On the other hand, cerebellar cTBS induced the opposite effect, slowing the rate of error reduction in both learning and re-adaptation phases. Additionally, TMS/EEG recordings showed that cerebellar iTBS induced speciﬁc changes of cortical activity in the interconnected motor networks. The improved performance was accompanied by an increase of TMSevoked cortical activity and a generalized desynchronization of TMS-evoked cortical oscillations. Taken together, our behavioral and neurophysiological ﬁndings provide the ﬁrst-time multimodal evidence of the potential efﬁcacy of cerebellar TBS in improving motor learning, by promoting successful cerebellar-cortical reorganization.},

	abstract = {Visuomotor adaptation (VMA) is a form of motor learning essential for performing day to day routines. Theoretical models and empirical evidence suggest a speciﬁc cortico-striato-cerebellar loop that mediates early and late learning in VMA. Here, we investigated dynamic changes in neural activity and connectivity when learning a novel visuomotor rotation using fMRI. We found that motor cortical regions, parietal cortex and cerebellum are recruited in the early phase of VMA, gradually reduce their activity as learning reaches plateau and rebound when the visuomotor rotation is removed. At this phase, dubbed de-adaptation, individual performance correlated with activity in motor and parietal cortex such that stronger activity was associated with better performance. Theory suggests that VMA is governed by the cortico-striato-cerebellar network during the early phase of learning and by the cortico-cerebellar loop at later stages. We tested this hypothesis using dynamic causal modelling and found distinct modulation of a cerebellar to dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC) loop. Speciﬁcally, the cerebellar to dPMC connection was modulated during adaptation, suggesting a release of inhibition and net excitatory effect of cerebellum on dPMC. The modulation of cerebellar to dPMC connection during de-adaptation was speciﬁcally related to behavioral learning parameter: stronger release of inhibition of the cerebellar to dPMC connection was associated with better de-adaptation. We interpret these ﬁndings to reﬂect dynamic interactions between representation of movement in cerebellum and visuomotor integration in dPMC.},

The higher area attempts to fit its abstractions to the data it receives from lower areas by sending back to them from its deep pyramidal cells a template reconstruction best fitting the lower level view. The lower area attempts to reconcile the reconstruction of its view that it receives from higher areas with what it knows, sending back from its superficial pyramidal cells the features in its data which are not predicted by the higher area. The whole calculation is done with all areas working simultaneously, but with order imposed by synchronous activity in the various top-down, bottom-up loops.

Given the biological constraints that the system had to satisfy, the approach performs surprisingly well: It has the capability of learning from only a few training examples and competes with state-of-the-art systems. We also discuss the existence of a universal, redundant dictionary of features that could handle the recognition of most object categories.

At its core, effective prediction requires an internal model of the world and an understanding of the rules by which the world changes. Here, we explore the internal models developed by deep neural networks trained using a loss based on predicting future frames in synthetic video sequences, using a CNNLSTM-deCNN framework. We ﬁrst show that this architecture can achieve excellent performance in visual sequence prediction tasks, including state-of-theart performance in a standard “bouncing balls” dataset (Sutskever et al., 2009). Using a weighted mean-squared error and adversarial loss (Goodfellow et al., 2014), the same architecture successfully extrapolates out-of-the-plane rotations of computer-generated faces. Furthermore, despite being trained end-to-end to predict only pixel-level information, our Predictive Generative Networks learn a representation of the latent structure of the underlying three-dimensional objects themselves. Importantly, we ﬁnd that this representation is naturally tolerant to object transformations, and generalizes well to new tasks, such as classiﬁcation of static images. Similar models trained solely with a reconstruction loss fail to generalize as effectively. We argue that prediction can serve as a powerful unsupervised loss for learning rich internal representations of high-level object features.},

          Experimental studies in neuroscience are producing data at a rapidly increasing rate, providing exciting opportunities and formidable challenges to existing theoretical and modeling approaches. To turn massive datasets into predictive quantitative frameworks, the field needs software solutions for systematic integration of data into realistic, multiscale models. Here we describe the Brain Modeling ToolKit (BMTK), a software suite for building models and performing simulations at multiple levels of resolution, from biophysically detailed multi-compartmental, to point-neuron, to population-statistical approaches. Leveraging the SONATA file format and existing software such as NEURON, NEST, and others, BMTK offers consistent user experience across multiple levels of resolution. It permits highly sophisticated simulations to be set up with little coding required, thus lowering entry barriers to new users. We illustrate successful applications of BMTK to large-scale simulations of a cortical area. BMTK is an open-source package provided as a resource supporting modeling-based discovery in the community.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10734},
	abstract = {While deep neural networks take loose inspiration from neuroscience, it is an open question how seriously to take the analogies between artiﬁcial deep networks and biological neuronal systems. Interestingly, recent work has shown that deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on large-scale image recognition tasks can serve as strikingly good models for predicting the responses of neurons in visual cortex to visual stimuli, suggesting that analogies between artiﬁcial and biological neural networks may be more than superﬁcial. However, while CNNs capture key properties of the average responses of cortical neurons, they fail to explain other properties of these neurons. For one, CNNs typically require large quantities of labeled input data for training. Our own brains, in contrast, rarely have access to this kind of supervision, so to the extent that representations are similar between CNNs and brains, this similarity must arise via different training paths. In addition, neurons in visual cortex produce complex time-varying responses even to static inputs, and they dynamically tune themselves to temporal regularities in the visual environment. We argue that these differences are clues to fundamental differences between the computations performed in the brain and in deep networks. To begin to close the gap, here we study the emergent properties of a previouslydescribed recurrent generative network that is trained to predict future video frames in a self-supervised manner. Remarkably, the model is able to capture a wide variety of seemingly disparate phenomena observed in visual cortex, ranging from single unit response dynamics to complex perceptual motion illusions. These results suggest potentially deep connections between recurrent predictive neural network models and the brain, providing new leads that can enrich both ﬁelds.},

Our data cannot be explained by differential eye movements, activation from the fixation cross, or spillover activation from peripheral retinotopic cortex or from LOC.

The characteristics of this phenomenon have important theoretical implications for the role fovea-specific feedback might play in perception. In this work, we employed a recently developed behavioral paradigm to explore whether late disruption to central visual space impaired perception of color. In the first experiment, participants performed a shape discrimination task on colored novel objects in the periphery while fixating centrally. Consistent with the results from previous work, a visual distractor presented at fixation {\textasciitilde}100ms after presentation of the peripheral stimuli impaired sensitivity to differences in peripheral shapes more than a visual distractor presented at other stimulus onset asynchronies. In a second experiment, participants performed a color discrimination task on the same colored objects. In a third experiment, we further tested for this foveal distractor effect with stimuli restricted to a low-level feature by using homogenous color patches. These two latter experiments resulted in a similar pattern of behavior: a central distractor presented at the critical stimulus onset asynchrony impaired sensitivity to peripheral color differences, but, importantly, the magnitude of the effect was stronger when peripheral objects contained complex shape information. These results show a behavioral effect consistent with disrupting feedback to the fovea, in line with the foveal feedback suggested by previous neuroimaging studies.},

Despite this wellknown fact, neuroimaging studies have found information about peripheral objects in the foveal conﬂuence, the cortical region representing the fovea. Further, this information is behaviorally relevant: disrupting the foveal conﬂuence using transcranial magnetic stimulation impairs discrimination of peripheral objects at time-points consistent with a disruption of feedback. If the foveal conﬂuence receives feedback of information about peripheral objects to boost vision, there should be behavioral consequences of this phenomenon. Here, we tested the effect of foveal distractors at different stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) on discrimination of peripheral targets. Participants performed a discrimination task on target objects presented in the periphery while ﬁxating centrally. A visual distractor presented at the fovea ∼100 ms after presentation of the targets disrupted performance more than a central distractor presented at other SOAs. This was speciﬁc to a central distractor; a peripheral distractor at the same time point did not have the same effect. These results are consistent with the claim that foveal retinotopic cortex is recruited for extra-foveal perception. This study describes a new paradigm for investigating the nature of the foveal feedback phenomenon and demonstrates the importance of this feedback in peripheral vision.},

Results revealed a selective impairment of performance when foveal noise was presented at 250-ms SOA, but only for tasks that required comparing objects’ spatial details, suggesting a task- and stimulus-dependent foveal processing mechanism. Critically, the temporal window of foveal processing was shifted when mental rotation was required for the peripheral objects, indicating that the foveal retinotopic processing is not automatically engaged at a fixed time following peripheral stimulation; rather, it occurs at a stage when detailed information is required. Moreover, fMRI measurements using multivoxel pattern analysis showed that both image and object category-relevant information of peripheral objects was represented in the foveal cortex.

Critically, the temporal window of foveal processing was shifted when mental rotation was required for the peripheral objects, indicating that the foveal retinotopic processing is not automatically engaged at a fixed time following peripheral stimulation; rather, it occurs at a stage when detailed information is required. Moreover, fMRI measurements using multivoxel pattern analysis showed that both image and object category-relevant information of peripheral objects was represented in the foveal cortex. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis of a temporally flexible feedback signal to the foveal retinotopic cortex when discriminating objects in the visual periphery.},

Areas V1, V2, and V5/MT are conserved across mammals and are central for visual behavior. To facilitate the generation of biologically accurate computational models of primate early visual processing, here we provide an overview of over 350 published studies of these three areas in the genus Macaca, whose visual system provides the closest model for human vision. The literature reports 14 anatomical connection types from the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus to V1 having distinct layers of origin or termination, and 194 connection types between V1, V2, and V5, forming multiple parallel and interacting visual processing streams. Moreover, within V1, there are reports of 286 and 120 types of intrinsic excitatory and inhibitory connections, respectively. Physiologically, tuning of neuronal responses to 11 types of visual stimulus parameters has been consistently reported. Overall, the optimal spatial frequency (SF) of constituent neurons decreases with cortical hierarchy. Moreover, V5 neurons are distinct from neurons in other areas for their higher direction selectivity, higher contrast sensitivity, higher temporal frequency tuning, and wider SF bandwidth. We also discuss currently unavailable data that could be useful for biologically accurate models.},

As a prime example, convolutional neural networks, a type of feedforward neural networks, are now approaching – and sometimes even surpassing – human accuracy on a variety of visual recognition tasks. Here, however, we show that these neural networks and their recent extensions struggle in recognition tasks where co-dependent visual features must be detected over long spatial ranges. We introduce a visual challenge, Pathﬁnder, and describe a novel recurrent neural network architecture called the horizontal gated recurrent unit (hGRU) to learn intrinsic horizontal connections – both within and across feature columns. We demonstrate that a single hGRU layer matches or outperforms all tested feedforward hierarchical baselines including state-of-the-art architectures with orders of magnitude more parameters.},

Further, they are quantitatively accurate models of temporally-averaged responses of neurons in the primate brain’s visual system. However, biological visual systems have two ubiquitous architectural features not shared with typical CNNs: local recurrence within cortical areas, and long-range feedback from downstream areas to upstream areas. Here we explored the role of recurrence in improving classiﬁcation performance. We found that standard forms of recurrence (vanilla RNNs and LSTMs) do not perform well within deep CNNs on the ImageNet task. In contrast, novel cells that incorporated two structural features, bypassing and gating, were able to boost task accuracy substantially. We extended these design principles in an automated search over thousands of model architectures, which identiﬁed novel local recurrent cells and long-range feedback connections useful for object recognition. Moreover, these task-optimized ConvRNNs matched the dynamics of neural activity in the primate visual system better than feedforward networks, suggesting a role for the brain’s recurrent connections in performing difﬁcult visual behaviors.},

Correcting this illusion signiﬁcantly reduces γ-Net contour detection accuracy by driving it to prefer lowlevel edges over high-level object boundary contours. Overall, our study suggests that the orientation-tilt illusion is a byproduct of neural circuits that help biological visual systems achieve robust and efﬁcient contour detection, and that incorporating such circuits in artiﬁcial neural networks can improve computer vision.},

	abstract = {Neuroscience has focused on the detailed implementation of computation, studying neural codes, dynamics and circuits. In machine learning, however, artiﬁcial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) the cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. In support of these hypotheses, we argue that a range of implementations of credit assignment through multiple layers of neurons are compatible with our current knowledge of neural circuitry, and that the brain’s specialized systems can be interpreted as enabling efﬁcient optimization for speciﬁc problem classes. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efﬁcient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by which neuroscience could seek to reﬁne and test these hypotheses.},

	abstract = {We studied how subjects learned to make movements against unpredictable perturbations. Twelve healthy human subjects made goal-directed reaching movements in the horizontal plane while holding the handle of a two-joint robotic manipulator. The robot generated viscous force fields that perturbed the limb perpendicular to the desired direction of movement. The amplitude (but not the direction) of the viscous field varied randomly from trial to trial. Systems identification techniques were employed to characterize how subjects adapted to these random perturbations. Subject performance was quantified primarily using the peak deviation from a straight-line hand path. Subjects adapted their arm movements to the sequence of random force-field amplitudes. This adaptive response compensated for the approximate mean from the random sequence of perturbations and did not depend on the statistical distribution of that sequence. Subjects did not adapt by directly counteracting the mean field strength itself on each trial but rather by using information about perturbations and movement errors from a limited number of previous trials to adjust motor commands on subsequent trials. This strategy permitted subjects to achieve near-optimal performance (defined as minimizing movement errors in a least-squares sense) while maintaining computational efficiency. A simple model using information about movement errors and perturbation amplitudes from a single previous trial predicted subject performance in stochastic environments with a high degree of fidelity and further predicted key performance features observed in nonstochastic environments. This suggests that the neural structures modified during motor adaptation require only short-term memory. Explicit representations regarding movements made more than a few trials in the past are not used in generating optimal motor responses on any given trial.},

Here I test the hypothesis that GCs enhance the capacity of Purkinje-like cells to generate speciﬁc negative images by selectively encoding combinations of sensory and motor signals. Using in vivo whole-cell recordings, I show (1) that a subset of GCs integrate sensory and motor signals conveyed by distinct mossy ﬁber classes and (2) that Purkinje-like cells exhibit plastic changes speciﬁc to the combinations of signals that individual GCs encode. Consistent with inﬂuential theories of cerebellar function, these ﬁndings suggest that selective GC output enhances the capacity of Purkinje-like cells to acquire selectivity through associative plasticity.},

	abstract = {Feed forward control and estimates of the future state of the motor system are critical for fast and coordinated movements. One framework for generating these predictive signals is based on the central nervous system implementing internal models. Internal models provide for representations of the input–output properties of the motor apparatus or their inverses. It has been widely hypothesized that the cerebellum acquires and stores internal models of the motor apparatus. The results of psychophysical, functional imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation studies in normal subjects support this hypothesis. Also, the deficits in patients with cerebellar dysfunction can be attributed to a failure of predictive feed forward control and/or to accurately estimate the consequences of motor commands. Furthermore, the computation performed by the cerebellar-like electrosensory lobes in several groups of fishes is to predict the sensory consequences of motor commands. However, only a few electrophysiological investigations have directly tested whether neurons in the cerebellar cortex have the requisite signals compatible with either an inverse or forward internal model. Our studies in the monkey performing manual pursuit tracking demonstrate that the simple spike discharge of Purkinje cells does not have the dynamics-related signals required to be the output of an inverse dynamics model. However, Purkinje cell firing has several of the characteristics of a forward internal model of the arm. A synthesis of the evidence suggests that the cerebellum is involved in integrating the current state of the motor system with internally generated motor commands to predict the future state.},

The present study examined this process in a task where human subjects moved the index ﬁngertip clockwise around the circumference of a virtual sphere created by a robotic device. The ﬁngertip pressed into the sphere during the movement, and the subjects were to report slight differences in sphere size (or surface curvature), which occurred from trial to trial. During each 2- to 3-s trial, subjects gradually adjusted their speed and pressure according to the current surface curvature, achieving a consistent level of contact force in the last half of the exploration. The results demonstrate that subjects were gradually accumulating haptic information about curvature and, at the same time, gradually changing the motor commands for the movement. When subjects encountered an unexpected transition in curvature (from circular to ﬂat), they reacted by abruptly decreasing contact force at a latency of about 50 ms. This short latency indicates that spinally mediated corrections are engaged during this task. The results support the hypothesis that during haptic exploration, the neural comparison between expected and actual somatosensory feedback takes places at multiple levels, including the spinal cord.},

To achieve this, the nervous system needs to estimate central variables for our movement based on past knowledge and new feedback, both of which are uncertain. In the Bayesian framework, rates of adaptation characterize how noisy feedback is in comparison to the uncertainty of the state estimate.The predictions of Bayesian models are intuitive: the nervous system should adapt slower when sensory feedback is more noisy and faster when its state estimate is more uncertain. Here we want to quantitatively understand how uncertainty in these two factors affects motor adaptation. In a hand reaching experiment we measured trial-by-trial adaptation to a randomly changing visual perturbation to characterize the way the nervous system handles uncertainty in state estimation and feedback. We found both qualitative predictions of Bayesian models confirmed. Our study provides evidence that the nervous system represents and uses uncertainty in state estimate and feedback during motor adaptation.},

	abstract = {The motor cortex controls motor behaviors by generating movement-specific signals and transmitting them through spinal cord circuits and motoneurons to the muscles. Precise and well-coordinated muscle activation patterns are necessary for accurate movement execution. Therefore, the activity of cortical neurons should correlate with movement parameters. To investigate the specifics of such correlations among activities of the motor cortex, spinal cord network and muscles, we developed a model for neural control of goal-directed reaching movements that simulates the entire pathway from the motor cortex through spinal cord circuits to the muscles controlling arm movements. In this model, the arm consists of two joints (shoulder and elbow), whose movements are actuated by six muscles (4 single-joint and 2 double-joint flexors and extensors). The muscles provide afferent feedback to the spinal cord circuits. Cortical neurons are defined as cortical "controllers" that solve an inverse problem based on a proposed straight-line trajectory to a target position and a predefined bell-shaped velocity profile. Thus, the controller generates a motor program that produces a task-specific activation of low-level spinal circuits that in turn induce the muscle activation realizing the intended reaching movement. Using the model, we describe the mechanisms of correlation between cortical and motoneuronal activities and movement direction and other movement parameters. We show that the directional modulation of neuronal activity in the motor cortex and the spinal cord may result from direction-specific dynamics of muscle lengths. Our model suggests that directional modulation first emerges at the level of muscle forces, augments at the motoneuron level, and further increases at the level of the motor cortex due to the dependence of frictional forces in the joints, contractility of the muscles and afferent feedback on muscle lengths and/or velocities.},

	abstract = {Cholinergic interneurons provide rich local innervation of the striatum and play an important role in controlling behavior, as evidenced by the variety of movement and psychiatric disorders linked to disrupted striatal cholinergic transmission. Much progress has been made in recent years regarding our understanding of how these interneurons contribute to the processing of information in the striatum. In particular, investigation of the activity of presumed striatal cholinergic interneurons, identiﬁed as tonically active neurons or TANs in behaving animals, has pointed to their role in the signaling and learning of the motivational relevance of environmental stimuli. Although the bulk of this work has been conducted in monkeys, several studies have also been carried out in behaving rats, but information remains rather disparate across studies and it is still questionable whether rodent TANs correspond to TANs described in monkeys. Consequently, our current understanding of the function of cholinergic transmission in the striatum is challenged by the rapidly growing, but often confusing literature on the relationship between TAN activity and speciﬁc behaviors. As regards the precise nature of the information conveyed by the cholinergic TANs, a recent inﬂuential view emphasized that these local circuit neurons may play a special role in the processing of contextual information that is important for reinforcement learning and selection of appropriate actions. This review provides a summary of recent progress in TAN physiology from which it is proposed that striatal cholinergic interneurons are crucial elements for ﬂexible switching of behaviors under changing environmental conditions.

	abstract = {An animal’s choice behavior is shaped by the outcome feedback from selected actions in a trial-and-error approach. Tonically active neurons (TANs), presumed cholinergic interneurons in the striatum, are thought to be involved in the learning and performance of reward-directed behaviors, but it remains unclear how TANs are involved in shaping reward-directed choice behaviors based on the outcome feedback. To this end, we recorded activity of TANs from the dorsal striatum of two macaque monkeys (Macaca fuscata; 1 male, 1 female) while they performed a multi-step choice task to obtain multiple rewards. In this task, the monkeys first searched for a rewarding target from among three alternatives in a trial-and-error manner and then earned additional rewards by repeatedly choosing the rewarded target. We found that a considerable proportion of TANs selectively responded to either the reward or the no-reward outcome feedback during the trial-anderror search, but these feedback responses were not observed during repeat trials. Moreover, the feedback responses of TANs were similarly observed in any search trials, without distinctions regarding the predicted probability of rewards and the location of chosen targets. Unambiguously, TANs detected reward and no-reward feedback specifically when the monkeys performed trial-and-error searches, in which the monkeys were learning the value of the targets and adjusting their subsequent choice behavior based on the reward and no-reward feedback. These results suggest that striatal cholinergic interneurons signal outcome feedback specifically during search behavior, in circumstances where the choice outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty by the animals.},

	abstract = {Convergent evidence suggests that the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning by adjusting action values according to reward prediction errors. However, adaptive behavior in stochastic environments requires the consideration of uncertainty to dynamically adjust the learning rate. We consider how cholinergic tonically active interneurons (TANs) may endow the striatum with such a mechanism in computational models spanning three Marr's levels of analysis. In the neural model, TANs modulate the excitability of spiny neurons, their population response to reinforcement, and hence the effective learning rate. Long TAN pauses facilitated robustness to spurious outcomes by increasing divergence in synaptic weights between neurons coding for alternative action values, whereas short TAN pauses facilitated stochastic behavior but increased responsiveness to change-points in outcome contingencies. A feedback control system allowed TAN pauses to be dynamically modulated by uncertainty across the spiny neuron population, allowing the system to self-tune and optimize performance across stochastic environments.
          , 
            One of the keys to successful learning is being able to adjust behavior on the basis of experience. In simple terms, it pays to repeat behaviors with positive outcomes and avoid those with negative outcomes. A group of brain regions known collectively as the basal ganglia supports this process by guiding behavior based on trial and error.
            However, circumstances can and do change: a behavior that routinely produces a positive outcome now will not necessarily always do so in the future. The outcome of a given behavior can also vary from time to time purely by chance: even the most appropriate action can sometimes lead to a negative outcome but should be repeated again. Exactly how the basal ganglia take into account this uncertainty over behavioral outcomes to appropriately guide learning is unclear.
            Franklin and Frank have now come up with a possible explanation by building on an existing computational model of the basal ganglia. Whereas the old model assumes that the rate of learning given an unexpected outcome always remains constant, in the new model learning occurs more quickly when the outcome of a behavior is uncertain. This makes intuitive sense, in that rapid learning is especially useful during the initial stages of learning a new task or following a sudden change in circumstances.
            The new model proposes that a group of cells called tonically active interneurons (TANs), which release the chemical acetylcholine, enable the basal ganglia to take account of uncertainty. TANs are found in a basal ganglia structure called the striatum and have a characteristic firing pattern during important outcomes, consisting of a burst of activity followed by a pause lasting several hundred milliseconds. The model suggests that when the outcome of a behavior is uncertain, the length of this pause is increased. This boosts the activity of another group of neurons in the striatum, known as spiny neurons, and this in turn increases the rate of learning.
            Franklin and Frank found that by varying the length of the TAN pause, the basal ganglia can adjust learning rates based on the degree of uncertainty over behavioral outcomes. Comparisons show that the TAN computational model optimizes the accuracy and flexibility of learning across different environments, while also accounting for findings which show that TAN lesions induce insensitivity to changes in decision outcomes. The next step is to test some of the new predictions about uncertainty experimentally.},

Striatal CINs exhibit tonic firing punctuated by distinct pauses. Pauses occur in response to motivationally significant events, but their function is unknown. Here we investigated the effects of pauses in CIN firing on spiny projection neurons (SPNs) – the output neurons of the striatum – using in vivo whole cell and juxtacellular recordings in mice. We found that optogenetically-induced pauses in CIN firing inhibited subthreshold membrane potential activity and decreased firing of SPNs. During pauses, SPN membrane potential fluctuations became more hyperpolarized and UP state durations became shorter. In addition, short-term plasticity of corticostriatal inputs was decreased during pauses. Our results indicate that, in vivo, the net effect of the pause in CIN firing on SPNs activity is inhibition and provide a novel mechanism for cholinergic control of striatal output.
          , 
            Nerve cells or neurons communicate with one another using electrical impulses and chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. Additional molecules known as neuromodulators regulate the communication process. In contrast to neurotransmitters, neuromodulators do not send messages directly from one neuron to the next. Instead they change the way that neurons respond to neurotransmitters.
            For example, the neuromodulator acetylcholine is most abundant in a region called the striatum. Located deep within the brain, the striatum contributes to learning and memory, motivation, and movement. Studies in rodents show that neurons within the striatum called cholinergic interneurons are almost continuously active. Each time these cells fire, they release acetylcholine. But whenever an animal experiences something unusual or important, the interneurons temporarily stop firing. Zucca et al. wanted to know whether these pauses in firing also act as a signal within the striatum.
            To find out, Zucca et al. inserted a light-sensitive ion channel into cholinergic interneurons in the mouse striatum. Activating the ion channels with a laser beam stopped the interneurons from firing. Zucca et al. showed that these pauses in firing reduced the activity of another group of neurons, the spiny projection neurons. These are the major output neurons of the striatum. They send messages from the striatum to other parts of the brain. The results thus suggest that cholinergic interneurons signal notable events by temporarily blocking output from the striatum.
            Understanding how cholinergic interneurons work will help reveal how the striatum drives behavior. It may also lead to treatments for diseases caused by cholinergic system dysfunction. Many patients with Parkinson’s disease or schizophrenia take medicines to block the effects of acetylcholine. Understanding how acetylcholine affects the striatum may help clarify how these treatments work.},

	abstract = {It is widely accepted that the basal ganglia (BG) play a key role in action selection and reinforcement learning. However, despite considerable number of studies, the BG architecture and function are not completely understood. Action selection and reinforcement learning are facilitated by the activity of dopaminergic neurons, which encode reward prediction errors when reward outcomes are higher or lower than expected. The BG are thought to select proper motor responses by gating appropriate actions, and suppressing inappropriate ones. The direct striato-nigral (GO) and the indirect striato-pallidal (NOGO) pathways have been suggested to provide the functions of BG in the two-pathway concept. Previous models conﬁrmed the idea that these two pathways can mediate the behavioral choice, but only for a relatively small number of potential behaviors. Recent studies have provided new evidence of BG involvement in motor adaptation tasks, in which adaptation occurs in a non-error-based manner. In such tasks, there is a continuum of possible actions, each represented by a complex neuronal activity pattern. We extended the classical concept of the two-pathway BG by creating a model of BG interacting with a movement execution system, which allows for an arbitrary number of possible actions. The model includes sensory and premotor cortices, BG, a spinal cord network, and a virtual mechanical arm performing 2D reaching movements. The arm is composed of 2 joints (shoulder and elbow) controlled by 6 muscles (4 mono-articular and 2 bi-articular). The spinal cord network contains motoneurons, controlling the muscles, and sensory interneurons that receive afferent feedback and mediate basic reﬂexes. Given a speciﬁc goal-oriented motor task, the BG network through reinforcement learning constructs a behavior from an arbitrary number of basic actions represented by cortical activity patterns. Our study conﬁrms that, with slight modiﬁcations, the classical two-pathway BG concept is consistent with results of previous studies, including non-error based motor adaptation experiments, pharmacological manipulations with BG nuclei, and functional deﬁcits observed in BG-related motor disorders.},

	abstract = {Within the striatum, cholinergic interneurons, electrophysiologically identiﬁed as tonically active neurons (TANs), represent a relatively homogeneous group in terms of their functional properties. They display typical pause in tonic ﬁring in response to rewarding events which are of crucial importance for reinforcement learning. These responses are uniformly distributed throughout the dorsal striatum (i.e., motor and associative striatum), but it is unknown, at least in monkeys, whether differences in the modulation of TAN activity exist in the ventral striatum (i.e., limbic striatum), a region specialized for processing of motivational information. To address this issue, we examined the activity of dorsal and ventral TANs in two monkeys trained on a Pavlovian conditioning task in which a visual stimulus preceded the delivery of liquid reward by a ﬁxed time interval. We found that the proportion of TANs responding to the stimulus predictive of reward did not vary signiﬁcantly across regions (58\%–80\%), whereas the fraction of TANs responding to reward was higher in the limbic striatum (100\%) compared to the motor (65\%) and associative striatum (52\%). By examining TAN modulation at the level of both the population and the individual neurons, we showed that the duration of pause responses to the stimulus and reward was longer in the ventral than in the dorsal striatal regions. Also, the magnitude of the pause was greater in ventral than dorsal striatum for the stimulus predictive of reward but not for the reward itself. We found similar region-speciﬁc differences in pause response duration to the stimulus when the timing of reward was less predictable (ﬁxed replaced by variable time interval). Regional variations in the duration and magnitude of the pause response were transferred from the stimulus to reward when reward was delivered in the absence of any predictive stimulus. It therefore appears that ventral TANs exhibit stronger responses to rewarding stimuli, compared to dorsal TANs. The high proportion of responsive neurons, combined with particular response features, support the notion that the ventral TAN system can be driven by speciﬁc synaptic inputs arising from afferent sources distinct from those targeting the dorsal TAN system.},

	abstract = {Striatal cholinergic interneurons, the so-called tonically active neurons (TANs), pause their ﬁring in response to sensory cues and rewards during classical conditioning and instrumental tasks. The respective pause responses observed can demonstrate many commonalities, such as constant latency and duration, synchronous occurrence in a population of cells, and coincidence with phasic activities of midbrain dopamine neurons (DANs) that signal reward predictions and errors. Pauses can however also show divergent properties. Pause latencies and durations can differ in a given TAN between appetitive vs. aversive outcomes in classical conditioning, initial excitation can be present or absent, and a second pause can variably follow a rebound. Despite more than 20 years of study, the functions of these pause responses are still elusive. Our understanding of pause function is hindered by an incomplete understanding of how pauses are generated. In this mini-review article, we compare pause types, as well as current key hypotheses for inputs underlying pauses that include dopamineinduced inhibition through D2-receptors, a GABA input from ventral tegmental area, and a prolonged afterhyperpolarization induced by excitatory input from the cortex or from the thalamus. We review how each of these mechanisms alone explains some but not all aspects of pause responses. These mechanisms might need to operate in speciﬁc but variable sets of sequences to generate a full range of pause responses. Alternatively, these mechanisms might operate in conjunction with an underlying control mechanism within cholinergic interneurons which could potentially provide a framework to generate the common themes and variations seen amongst pause responses.},

	abstract = {Striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are the main source of acetylcholine in the striatum and are believed to play an important role in basal ganglia physiology and pathophysiology. The role of CINs in striatal function is known mostly from extracellular recordings of tonically active striatal neurons in monkeys, which are believed to correspond to CINs. Because these neurons transiently respond to motivationally cues with brief pauses, ﬂanked by bursts of increased activity, they are classically viewed as key players in reward-related learning. However, CIN modulatory function within the striatal network has been mainly inferred from the action of acetylcholine agonists/antagonists or through CIN activation. These manipulations are far from recapitulating CIN activity in response to behaviorally-relevant stimuli. New technical tools such as optogenetics allow researchers to speciﬁcally manipulate this sparse neuronal population and to mimic their typical pause response. For example, it is now possible to investigate how short inhibition of CIN activity shapes striatal properties. Here, we review the most recent literature and show how these new techniques have brought considerable insights into the functional role of CINs in normal and pathological states, raising several interesting and novel questions. To continue moving forward, it is crucial to determine in detail CIN activity changes during behavior, particularly in rodents. We will also discuss how computational approaches combined with optogenetics will contribute to further our understanding of the CIN role in striatal circuits.},

	abstract = {The motor cortex controls motor behaviors by generating movement-specific signals and transmitting them through spinal cord circuits and motoneurons to the muscles. Precise and well-coordinated muscle activation patterns are necessary for accurate movement execution. Therefore, the activity of cortical neurons should correlate with movement parameters. To investigate the specifics of such correlations among activities of the motor cortex, spinal cord network and muscles, we developed a model for neural control of goal-directed reaching movements that simulates the entire pathway from the motor cortex through spinal cord circuits to the muscles controlling arm movements. In this model, the arm consists of two joints (shoulder and elbow), whose movements are actuated by six muscles (4 single-joint and 2 double-joint flexors and extensors). The muscles provide afferent feedback to the spinal cord circuits. Cortical neurons are defined as cortical "controllers" that solve an inverse problem based on a proposed straight-line trajectory to a target position and a predefined bell-shaped velocity profile. Thus, the controller generates a motor program that produces a task-specific activation of low-level spinal circuits that in turn induce the muscle activation realizing the intended reaching movement. Using the model, we describe the mechanisms of correlation between cortical and motoneuronal activities and movement direction and other movement parameters. We show that the directional modulation of neuronal activity in the motor cortex and the spinal cord may result from direction-specific dynamics of muscle lengths. Our model suggests that directional modulation first emerges at the level of muscle forces, augments at the motoneuron level, and further increases at the level of the motor cortex due to the dependence of frictional forces in the joints, contractility of the muscles and afferent feedback on muscle lengths and/or velocities.},

There are, however, visuomotor tasks where signed errors are unavailable or cannot be mapped onto appropriate motor command changes, rendering EB learning ineffective; and yet, healthy subjects can learn in these EB learning-free conditions. While EB learning depends on cerebellar integrity, the neural bases of EB-independent learning are poorly understood. As basal ganglia are involved in learning mechanisms that are independent of signed error feedback, here we tested whether patients with basal ganglia lesions, including those with Huntington’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, would show impairments in a visuomotor learning task that prevents the use of EB learning. We employed two visuomotor throwing tasks that were similar, but were profoundly different in the resulting visual feedback. This difference was implemented through the introduction of either a lateral displacement of the visual ﬁeld via a wedge prism (EB learning) or a horizontal reversal of the visual ﬁeld via a dove prism (non-EB learning). Our results show that patients with basal ganglia degeneration had normal EB learning in the wedge prism task, but were profoundly impaired in the reversing prism task that does not depend on the signed error signal feedback. These results represent the ﬁrst evidence that human visuomotor learning in the absence of EB feedback depends on the integrity of the basal ganglia.},

	abstract = {Free recall and recognition are simulated in a network model of the hippocampal formation, incorporating simpliﬁed simulations of neurons, synaptic connections, and the effects of acetylcholine. Simulations focus on modeling the effects of the acetylcholine receptor blocker scopolamine on human memory. Systemic administration of scopolamine is modeled by blockade of the cellular effects of acetylcholine in the model, resulting in memory impairments replicating data from studies on human subjects. This blockade of cholinergic effects impairs the encoding of new input patterns (as measured by delayed free recall), but does not impair the delayed free recall of input patterns learned before the blockade. The impairment is selective to the free recall but not the recognition of items encoded under the inﬂuence of scopolamine. In the model, scopolamine blocks strengthening of recurrent connections in region CA3 to form attractor states for new items (encoding impaired) but allows recurrent excitation to drive the network into previously stored attractor states (retrieval spared). Neuron populations representing items (individual words) have weaker recurrent connections than neuron populations representing experimental context. When scopolamine further weakens the strength of recurrent connections it selectively prevents the subsequent reactivation of item attractor states by context input (impaired free recall) without impairing the subsequent reactivation of context attractor states by item input (spared recognition). This asymmetry in the strength of attractor states also allows simulation of the list-strength effect for free recall but not recognition. Simulation of a paired associate learning paradigm predicts that scopolamine should greatly enhance proactive interference due to retrieval of previously encoded associations during storage of new associations. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {Loss of dopamine from the striatum can cause both profound motor deﬁcits, as in Parkinson’s disease, and disrupt learning.Yet the effect of dopamine on striatal neurons remains a complex and controversial topic, and is in need of a comprehensive framework. We extend a reduced model of the striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) to account for dopaminergic modulation of its intrinsic ion channels and synaptic inputs. We tune our D1 and D2 receptor MSN models using data from a recent large-scale compartmental model.The new models capture the input–output relationships for both current injection and spiking input with remarkable accuracy, despite the order of magnitude decrease in system size.They also capture the paired pulse facilitation shown by MSNs. Our dopamine models predict that synaptic effects dominate intrinsic effects for all levels of D1 and D2 receptor activation. We analytically derive a full set of equilibrium points and their stability for the original and dopamine modulated forms of the MSN model. We ﬁnd that the stability types are not changed by dopamine activation, and our models predict that the MSN is never bistable. Nonetheless, the MSN models can produce a spontaneously bimodal membrane potential similar to that recently observed in vitro following application of NMDA agonists. We demonstrate that this bimodality is created by modelling the agonist effects as slow, irregular and massive jumps in NMDA conductance and, rather than a form of bistability, is due to the voltage-dependent blockade of NMDA receptors. Our models also predict a more pronounced membrane potential bimodality following D1 receptor activation. This work thus establishes reduced yet accurate dopamine-modulated models of MSNs, suitable for use in large-scale models of the striatum. More importantly, these provide a tractable framework for further study of dopamine’s effects on computation by individual neurons.},

To isolate the influence of executive functions on timing from motor coordination effects, we dissociated executive load from the number of effectors used in the dual task situation. In 3 experiments, participants produced isochronous intervals ranging from 524 to 2,000 ms with either the left or the right hand. The concurrent task consisted of the production of either a pseudorandom (high cognitive load) or a simple repeated (low cognitive load) spatial sequence of key presses, while also maintaining a regular temporal sequence. This task was performed with either a single hand (unimanual) or with both hands simultaneously (bimanual). Interference in terms of increased timing variability caused by the concurrent task was observed only in the bimanual condition. We verified that motor coordination in bimanual tasks alone could not account for the interference. Timing interference only appeared when (a) more than 1 effector was involved and (b) there were simultaneous task demands that recruited executive functions. Task interference was not seen if only 1 of these 2 conditions was met. Thus, our results suggest that executive functions are not directly involved in motor timing, but can indirectly affect timing performance when they are required to schedule complex motor coordination.},

Converging evidence supports the notion that precisely because of its importance across a wide range of brain functions, timing relies on intrinsic and general properties of neurons and neural circuits, that is, the brain uses its natural cellular and network dynamics to solve a diversity of temporal computations. Many circuits have been shown to encode elapsed time in dynamically changing patterns of neural activity—so-called population clocks. But temporal processing encompasses a wide range of different computations, and just as there are different circuits and mechanisms underlying computations about space, there are a multitude of circuits and mechanisms underlying the ability to tell time and generate temporal patterns.},

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.03.15.992008},
	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          Sensorimotor adaptation is driven by sensory prediction errors, the difference between the predicted and actual feedback. When the position of the feedback is made uncertain, adaptation is attenuated. This effect, in the context of optimal sensory integration models, has been attributed to a weakening of the error signal driving adaptation. Here we consider an alternative hypothesis, namely that uncertainty alters the perceived location of the feedback. We present two visuomotor adaptation experiments to compare these hypotheses, varying the size and uncertainty of a visual error signal. Uncertainty attenuated learning when the error size was small but had no effect when the error size was large. This pattern of results favors the hypothesis that uncertainty does not impact the strength of the error signal, but rather, leads to mis-localization of the error. We formalize these ideas to offer a novel perspective on the effect of visual uncertainty on implicit sensorimotor adaptation.
          
            SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
            Current models of sensorimotor adaptation assume that the rate of learning will be related to properties of the error signal (e.g., size, consistency, relevance). Recent evidence has challenged this view, pointing to a rigid, modular system, one that automatically recalibrates the sensorimotor map in response to movement errors, with minimal constraint. In light of these developments, this study revisits the influence of feedback uncertainty on sensorimotor adaptation. Adaptation was attenuated in response to a noisy feedback signal, but the effect was only manifest for small errors and not for large errors. This interaction suggests that uncertainty does not weaken the error signal. Rather, it may influence the perceived location of the feedback and thus the change in the sensorimotor map induced by that error. These ideas are formalized to show how the motor system remains exquisitely calibrated, even if adaptation is largely insensitive to the statistics of error signals.},

While recent evidence supports this vision, cell type-speciﬁc online control on the activity of the cholinergic striatal neurons is necessary to empirically test it. In this study, we performed optogenetic manipulations of the activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) to evaluate their contribution to the updating of a previously learned instrumental contingency. By modulating the activity of CINs, we identiﬁed that the inhibition of CINs impairs the update of actions to a contingency change. Remarkably, a manipulation that perturbs the activity of CINs, rather than inhibiting them also impaired the encoding of the change in contingency. These results emphasize that beyond an increase in the activity of CINs, the intact activity of these cells is required for the identiﬁcation of an instrumental contingency change.

Striatal dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) are major regulators of motor activity through their signaling on striatal projection neurons and interneurons. We show that D2R signaling on cholinergic interneurons contributes to an in vitro pause in ﬁring of these otherwise tonically active neurons and to the striatal dopamine/acetylcholine balance. The selective ablation of D2R from cholinergic neurons allows discrimination between the motor-reducing and cataleptic effects of antipsychotics. The cataleptic effect of antipsychotics is triggered by blockade of D2R on cholinergic interneurons and the consequent increase of acetylcholine signaling on striatal projection neurons. These studies illuminate the critical role of D2R-mediated signaling in regulating the activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons and the mechanisms of typical antipsychotic side effects.},

There is broad consensus that the basal ganglia play a crucial role in the formation and ﬂuid performance of action sequences. To investigate the role of the basal ganglia direct and indirect pathways in action sequencing, we virally expressed Cre-dependent Gi-DREADDs in either the dorsomedial (DMS) or dorsolateral (DLS) striatum during and/ or after action sequence learning in D1 and D2 Cre rats. Action sequence performance in D1 Cre rats was slowed down early in training when DREADDs were activated in the DMS, but sped up when activated in the DLS. Acquisition of the reinforced sequence was hindered when DREADDs were activated in the DLS of D2 Cre rats. Outcome devaluation tests conducted after training revealed that the goal-directed control of action sequence rates was immune to chemogenetic inhibition—rats suppressed the rate of sequence performance when rewards were devalued. Sequence initiation latencies were generally sensitive to outcome devaluation, except in the case where DREADD activation was removed in D2 Cre rats that previously experienced DREADD activation in the DMS during training. Sequence completion latencies were generally not sensitive to outcome devaluation, except in the case where D1 Cre rats experienced DREADD activation in the DMS during training and test. Collectively, these results suggest that the indirect pathway originating from the DLS is part of a circuit involved in the eﬀective reinforcement of action sequences, while the direct and indirect pathways originating from the DMS contribute to the goal-directed control of sequence completion and initiation, respectively.},

	abstract = {One of the most marked differences to be identiﬁed in Parkinson’s disease is the change in activity of thalamic neurons in the motor circuits. Because dopamine replacement therapies largely alleviate these motor circuit abnormalities, it has been assumed that pathology in the basal ganglia is entirely responsible for the aberrant thalamic activity which then permeates the motor circuits. However, there is considerable evidence that pathology in the thalamus itself contributes to the abnormal neural activity characteristic of Parkinson’s disease. In a series of studies examining the degree of degeneration in the thalamus, we have observed selective degeneration in the intralaminar thalamic nuclei in patients with levodopa-responsive Parkinson’s disease. The nuclei involved are the caudal intralaminar nuclei (the centre-median/parafascicular complex), the parataenial, cucullar and central lateral nuclei. The centre-median/parafascicular complex provides important glutaminergic feedback from the thalamus to the putamen and is a pathway that is greatly enlarged in primates. There is 30–40\% loss in this region of the thalamus in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, with non-parvalbumin-containing neurons degenerating the most (70\% average loss). Our recent work suggests that the preservation of this pathway may contribute to dystonia in Parkinson’s disease. The central lateral and cucullar thalamic nuclei degenerate 30–50\%, while the parataenial nucleus sustains a 55\% loss of neurons in association with signiﬁcant a-synuclein deposition which correlates with disease duration. Damage to these regions appears to impact on cognition, awareness and perception. These studies suggest that direct thalamic pathology contributes to the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.},

Here, we show that optogenetic inhibition of CINs alleviates motor deﬁcits in PD mouse models, providing direct demonstration for their implication in parkinsonian motor dysfunctions. As neural correlates, CIN inhibition in parkinsonian mice differentially impacts the excitability of striatal D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons, normalizes pathological bursting activity in the main basal ganglia output structure, and increases the functional weight of the direct striatonigral pathway in cortical information processing. By contrast, CIN inhibition in nonlesioned mice does not affect locomotor activity, equally modulates medium spiny neuron excitability, and does not modify spontaneous or cortically driven activity in the basal ganglia output, suggesting that the role of these interneurons in motor function is highly dependent on dopamine tone.},

How chronic dopamine loss and replacement with levodopa modulate the ﬁring of identiﬁed MSNs in behaving animals is unknown. Using optogenetically labeled striatal single-unit recordings, we assess circuit dysfunction in parkinsonism and LID. Counter to current models, we found that following dopamine depletion, iMSN ﬁring was elevated only during periods of immobility, while dMSN ﬁring was dramatically and persistently reduced. Most notably, we identiﬁed a subpopulation of dMSNs with abnormally high levodopa-evoked ﬁring rates, which correlated speciﬁcally with dyskinesia.

We show that as humans practice reaching movements while interacting with a novel mechanical environment, they learn an internal model of the inverse dynamics of that environment. Subjects show recall of this model at testing sessions 24 hours after the initial practice. The representation of the internal model in memory is such that there is interference when there is an attempt to learn a new inverse dynamics map immediately after an anticorrelated mapping was learned. We suggest that this interference is an indication that the same computational elements used to encode the first inverse dynamics map are being used to learn the second mapping. We predict that this leads to a forgetting of the initially learned skill.},

There is currently no consensus on whether this phenomenon is transient or long lasting, with studies pointing to an effect in the time scale of hours to days. These inconsistencies might be caused by the method employed to quantify performance, which often confounds changes in learning rate and retention. Here, we aimed to unveil the time course of anterograde interference by tracking its impact on visuomotor adaptation at different intervals throughout a 24-h period. Our empirical and model-based approaches allowed us to measure the capacity for new learning separately from the inf luence of a previous memory. In agreement with previous reports, we found that prior learning persistently impaired the initial level of performance upon revisiting the task. However, despite this strong initial bias, learning capacity was impaired only when conf licting information was learned up to 1 h apart, recovering thereafter with passage of time. These findings suggest that when adapting to conf licting perturbations, impairments in performance are driven by two distinct mechanisms: a long-lasting bias that acts as a prior and hinders initial performance and a short-lasting anterograde interference that originates from a reduction in error sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Humans demonstrate a remarkable ability to generate accurate and appropriate motor behavior under many different and often uncertain environmental conditions. We previously proposed a new modular architecture, the modular selection and identification for control (MOSAIC) model, for motor learning and control based on multiple pairs of forward (predictor) and inverse (controller) models. The architecture simultaneously learns the multiple inverse models necessary for control as well as how to select the set of inverse models appropriate for a given environment. It combines both feedforward and feedback sensorimotor information so that the controllers can be selected both prior to movement and subsequently during movement. This article extends and evaluates the MOSAIC architecture in the following respects. The learning in the architecture was implemented by both the original gradient-descent method and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Unlike gradient descent, the newly derived EM algorithm is robust to the initial starting conditions and learning parameters. Second, simulations of an object manipulation task prove that the architecture can learn to manipulate multiple objects and switch between them appropriately. Moreover, after learning, the model shows generalization to novel objects whose dynamics lie within the polyhedra of already learned dynamics. Finally, when each of the dynamics is associated with a particular object shape, the model is able to select the appropriate controller before movement execution. When presented with a novel shape-dynamic pairing, inappropriate activation of modules is observed followed by on-line correction.},

	abstract = {Dual-state adaptation of motor responses has been known for some time. A more recent development is a form of dual-state adaptation known as “context-specific adaptation,” which was explored through the use of saccade gain adaptation. In this model, two different adapted saccade gains are associated with two different states of a context cue, and the gain switches between the two adapted states when the context cue changes state. Such adaptation is imposed by alternating context/adaptation states over the course of an adaptation session. Here, vertical eye position as a context cue for adaptation of horizontal saccade gain is used: gain increase is induced with the eyes up 10°, and gain decrease with the eyes down 10°. This context cue is not very effective: there is interference between context/adaptation conditions such that gaindecrease adaptation with eyes down transfers to the eyes-up (gain-increase) context. It was hypothesized that the juxtaposition in time of the alternating adaptation states exacerbated this interference. In order to test this, oneminute rest breaks were inserted between each change in context/adaptation state. The resulting context-specific adaptation improved dramatically: gainincrease and gain-decrease adaptations were more rapid and more complete. This resembles consolidation of motor learning, which, however, occurs over much longer time spans (hours rather than minutes). Thus, the results may reflect the operation of a novel “short-term” motor consolidation process.},

To investigate the circuit basis of such flexible behavior, we have developed a biophysically-based decision-making network model of spiking neurons for arbitrary sensorimotor mapping. The model quantitatively reproduces behavioral and prefrontal single-cell data from an experiment in which monkeys learn visuo-motor associations that are reversed unpredictably from time to time. We show that when synaptic modifications occur on multiple timescales, the model behavior becomes flexible only when needed: slow components of learning usually dominate the decision process. However, if behavioral contexts change frequently enough, fast components of plasticity take over, and the behavior exhibits a quick forget-and-learn pattern. This model prediction is confirmed by monkey data. Therefore, our work reveals a scenario for conditional associative learning that is distinct from instant switching between sets of well established sensorimotor associations.},

The authors propose 2 new algorithms for adaptively determining the nominal difficulty and the number of trials for each task on the basis of both current and delayed performance of the learner (N = 48). The authors tested the adaptive algorithms in a 2 × 2 factorial design, and they show that the algorithms outperform random scheduling when performance is measured on a delayed retention test.},

Supposedly, this is the case because a random schedule of practice necessitates more elaborate cognitive activities than a blocked schedule before each acquisition trial can be initiated. Our main objective was to determine whether the advantage for learning found for random practice increases as a function of the number of acquisition trials. During acquisition, the results indicated a general tendency for smaller movement reproduction errors under a blocked rather than a random schedule of practice. However, this effect disappeared with larger amount of acquisition trials. In retention, larger errors were observed when acquisition occurred under a blocked rather than a random schedule of practice. Finally, the disadvantage for learning observed for the blocked schedule of practice disappeared under a block-repeated condition in which each movement pattern was first practiced under a blocked schedule which was then repeated a second time. The results are discussed in terms of the so-called contextual interference effect and indicates some of its limitations.},

	abstract = {Humans can learn an enormous number of motor behaviors in different environments. To explain this, the MOSAIC model proposes that multiple internal models are acquired in the brain, which can be switched. However, previous behavioral studies that examined arm-movement adaptations to multiple environments reported a rather limited learning capability. Hitherto, humans have been believed incapable of learning two opposite viscous force fields, which are both dynamic transformations and depend on the same state variable, presented in a random order with only a visual cue. In contrast, this study found that humans are capable of this. Elbow joint movements to specified targets were perturbed by either resistive or assistive viscous force fields generated by a single degree-of-freedom manipulandum. The resistive or assistive viscous force fields were cued by a blue or red color on a CRT screen, respectively. The squared distance between the end point and the target, and the variance of the joint angular velocities were used as kinematic performance indices. These movement errors decreased significantly as a function of the training days. Aftereffects and learning consolidation were demonstrated in the random presentation of the two force fields. Consequently, humans were able to learn the multiple and distinct internal models of the two force fields and appropriately switch them even for a random presentation cued only by color after several days of training. This study suggests that none of the previously proposed conditions for multiple internal model learning are necessary prerequisites, and indicates that the difficulty in learning is determined by the balance between the effectiveness of contextual information and the similarity of force fields.},

	abstract = {We previously showed that the saccadic system could be adapted in a context-speciﬁc manner: two different adapted gains could be associated with two different context cues, with the gain state switched when the context state was switched. This was accomplished by alternating context/adaptation states several times over the course of an adaptation session, and assessing saccade gain in each context state before and after adaptation. One context cue we studied was vertical eye position; an adaptive gain increase was induced with the eyes up 10◦, and an adaptive gain decrease with the eyes down 10◦. This context cue was only partially effective: there was considerable undesired transfer of adaptation from the eyes-down condition (gain-decrease) to the eyes-up condition (gain-increase), with the result that there was little or no gain-increase adaptation. One explanation for this is that the two context/adaptation states, presented one after the other, interfered with each other. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis by interposing one-minute rest intervals between each alternation in context/adaptation state. The resulting context-speciﬁc adaptation is greatly improved (relative to the case when there are no rest intervals): both gain-increase and gain-decrease adaptations are stronger and occur more rapidly. This effect resembles that found in studies on the consolidation of motor learning, although such consolidation is believed to occur over much longer time spans (hours rather than minutes).},

In this paper, we propose a modular approach to such motor learning and control. We review the behavioral evidence and beneﬁts of modularity, and propose a new architecture based on multiple pairs of inverse (controller) and forward (predictor) models. Within each pair, the inverse and forward models are tightly coupled both during their acquisition, through motor learning, and use, during which the forward models determine the contribution of each inverse model’s output to the ﬁnal motor command. This architecture can simultaneously learn the multiple inverse models necessary for control as well as how to select the inverse models appropriate for a given environment. Finally, we describe speciﬁc predictions of the model, which can be tested experimentally. ᭧ 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Our results do not support this hypothesis. Subjects performed reaching movements in four sessions over 4 days. On the 1st day the robotic manipulandum perturbed the movement by perpendicular force that alternated its direction after each movement. Subjects were unable to construct the two underlying models and switch between them. On the 2nd day only one field was applied and well learned. On the 3rd day only the other field was applied and well learned. Then the experiment of the 1st day was repeated on the 4th day. Even after this extensive training subjects showed no signs of improved performance with alternating fields. This result combined with previous studies suggests that the central nervous system has a strong tendency to employ a single internal model when dealing with a sequence of perturbations.},

Subjects reached first in a “mean field” having a constant gain relating force and velocity, then in a “noise field,” having a gain that varied randomly between reaches according to a normal distribution with a mean identical to that of the mean field. The unpredictable nature of the noise field did not degrade adaptation as quantified by final kinematic error and rate of adaptation. To achieve this performance, the nervous system used a dual strategy. It increased the impedance of the arm as evidenced by a significant reduction in aftereffect size following removal of the noise field. Simultaneously, it formed an internal model of the mean of the random environment, as evidenced by a minimization of trajectory error on trials for which the noise field gain was close to the mean field gain. We conclude that the human motor system is capable of predicting and compensating for the dynamics of an environment that varies substantially and randomly from trial to trial, while simultaneously increasing the arm's impedance to minimize the consequence of errors in the prediction.},

Forty-nine subjects, divided into six groups, made reaching movements while holding a robotic arm that applied forces to the hand. On day 1, all subjects learned to move in force field A. On day 2, each group of subjects was tested on their ability to recall field A and their ability to learn a new internal model in field B. Four groups participated in the experiments of day 2 under the effects of lorazepam (LZ; a GABA type A receptor-positive allosteric modulator), dextromethorphan [DM; an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker], lamotrigine (LG, a drug that blocks voltage-gated Na

Two control groups were tested in a drug-free condition: one group that was not exposed to additional experimental protocols (NP) and another group was tested under ∼24 h of sleep deprivation between completion of learning on day 1 and start of testing on day 2 (SD). Recall of field A was normal in all groups. Learning of field B was reduced by LZ and DM but not by SP, LG, SD or in the NP condition. These results suggest that a 24-h sleep-deprivation period may have little or no effect on consolidation of this motor memory and that NMDA receptor activation and GABAergic inhibition are mechanisms operating in the acquisition but not recall of new motor memories in humans.},

	abstract = {It is possible that motor adaptation in the timescales of minutes is supported by two distinct processes: one process that learns slowly from error but has strong retention, and another that learns rapidly from error but has poor retention. This two-state model makes the prediction that if a period of adaptation is followed by a period of reverse-adaptation, then in the subsequent period in which errors are clamped to zero (error-clamp trials) there will be a spontaneous recovery, i.e., a rebound of behavior toward the initial level of adaptation. Here we tested and confirmed this prediction during double-step, on-axis, saccade adaptation. When people adapted their saccadic gain to a magnitude other than one (adaptation) and then the gain was rapidly reversed back to one (reverse-adaptation), in the subsequent error-clamp trials (visual target placed on the fovea after the saccade) the gain reverted toward the initially adapted value and then gradually reverted toward normal. We estimated that the fast system was about 20 times more sensitive to error than the slow system, but had a time constant of 28 seconds while the slow system had a time constant of nearly 8 minutes. Therefore, short-term adaptive mechanisms that maintain accuracy of saccades rely on a memory system that has characteristics of a multi-state process with a logarithmic distribution of timescales.},

	abstract = {Experience of a prediction error recruits multiple motor learning processes, some that learn strongly from error but have weak retention and some that learn weakly from error but exhibit strong retention. These processes are not generally observable but are inferred from their collective influence on behavior. Is there a robust way to uncover the hidden processes? A standard approach is to consider a state space model where the hidden states change following experience of error and then fit the model to the measured data by minimizing the squared error between measurement and model prediction. We found that this least-squares algorithm (LMSE) often yielded unrealistic predictions about the hidden states, possibly because of its neglect of the stochastic nature of error-based learning. We found that behavioral data during adaptation was better explained by a system in which both error-based learning and movement production were stochastic processes. To uncover the hidden states of learning, we developed a generalized expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. In simulation, we found that although LMSE tracked the measured data marginally better than EM, EM was far more accurate in unmasking the time courses and properties of the hidden states of learning. In a power analysis designed to measure the effect of an intervention on sensorimotor learning, EM significantly reduced the number of subjects that were required for effective hypothesis testing. In summary, we developed a new approach for analysis of data in sensorimotor experiments. The new algorithm improved the ability to uncover the multiple processes that contribute to learning from error.
            NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Motor learning is supported by multiple adaptive processes, each with distinct error sensitivity and forgetting rates. We developed a generalized expectation maximization algorithm that uncovers these hidden processes in the context of modern sensorimotor learning experiments that include error-clamp trials and set breaks. The resulting toolbox may improve the ability to identify the properties of these hidden processes and reduce the number of subjects needed to test the effectiveness of interventions on sensorimotor learning.},

          Deep artificial neural networks with spatially repeated processing (a.k.a., deep convolutional ANNs) have been established as the best class of candidate models of visual processing in primate ventral visual processing stream. Over the past five years, these ANNs have evolved from a simple feedforward eight-layer architecture in AlexNet to extremely deep and branching NAS-Net architectures, demonstrating increasingly better object categorization performance and increasingly better explanatory power of both neural and behavioral responses. However, from the neuroscientist’s point of view, the relationship between such very deep architectures and the ventral visual pathway is incomplete in at least two ways. On the one hand, current state-of-the-art ANNs appear to be too complex (e.g., now over 100 levels) compared with the relatively shallow cortical hierarchy (4-8 levels), which makes it difficult to map their elements to those in the ventral visual stream and to understand what they are doing. On the other hand, current state-of-the-art ANNs appear to be not complex enough in that they lack recurrent connections and the resulting neural response dynamics that are commonplace in the ventral visual stream. Here we describe our ongoing efforts to resolve both of these issues by developing a “CORnet” family of deep neural network architectures. Rather than just seeking high object recognition performance (as the state-of-the-art ANNs above), we instead try to reduce the model family to its most important elements and then gradually build new ANNs with recurrent and skip connections while monitoring both performance and the match between each new CORnet model and a large body of primate brain and behavioral data. We report here that our current best ANN model derived from this approach (CORnet-S) is among the top models on Brain-Score, a composite benchmark for comparing models to the brain, but is simpler than other deep ANNs in terms of the number of convolutions performed along the longest path of information processing in the model. All CORnet models are available at github.com/dicarlolab/CORnet, and we plan to up-date this manuscript and the available models in this family as they are produced.},

	abstract = {This research explored specific contextual cues that might facilitate human motor learning. Using a dual adaptation task, humans performed manual reaches to visual targets while experiencing a 30° clockwise or counterclockwise rotation, which randomly alternated between trials, of a seen cursor representing their unseen hand. Groups had different cues to distinguish between rotations: ‘Cue’ (colours and shapes), ‘Workspace’ (target locations) and ‘Workspace with Cue’ (combination of cues). Importantly, the workspace groups required similar hand movement trajectories to accurately acquire pairs of targets. Our data show that only the ‘Workspace’ and ‘Workspace with Cue’ groups, but not ‘Cue’ group, adapted to both rotations concurrently (dual adaption). These findings suggest that colour and shape cues, even when integrated with the end-effector and targets, do not facilitate dual adaptation. However, target separation is sufficient to facilitate dual adaptation, even when hand movement trajectories are similar. Interestingly, adaptation was less complete when required hand trajectories were completely overlapping for pairs of targets (versus being similar), suggesting an important role for the motor system as well. Nonetheless, the location of targets and consequent differences in motor planning may play a larger role in facilitating adaptation than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Recent motor learning studies show that human subjects and nonhuman primates form neural representations of novel mechanical environments and associated forces. Whereas proficient adaptation is seen for a single force field, when faced with multiple novel force environments, movement performance and in particular the ability to switch between different force environments declines. It is difficult to reconcile these findings with the notion that primates can proficiently switch between multiple motor skills. Conceivably, particular kinds of sensory, cognitive, or perceptual contextual cues are required. This study examined the effect of visual feedback on motor learning, in particular, cues that simulated interaction with a virtual object. A robot arm was used to deliver novel patterns of forces (force fields) to the limb during reaching movements. We tested the possibility that subjects transition more easily between novel forces and their sudden absence when they are accompanied by visual cues that relate to object grasp. We used a virtual display system to present subjects with different kinds of visual feedback during reaching, including illusory feedback, indicating grasp of a virtual object during reaching in the force field, and object release in the absence of forces. Throughout the experiment, subjects in fact maintained grasp of the robot. We found that, indeed, the most effective visual cues were those associating the force field with grasp of the virtual object and the absence of the force field with release of the object. Our findings show more broadly that specific visual cues can protect motor skills from interference.},

A large body of work has shown that conflicting internal models could not be learned simultaneously; this suggests either a limited capacity or the unstable nature of short-term motor memories. However, it has been recently shown that multiple conflicting internal models of motor behavior could be acquired simultaneously if associated with appropriate contextual cues and random presentations. We re-examined this issue in a more complex environment in which the magnitude of the conflicting fields could vary randomly. Human subjects failed to show any evidence of learning the force fields themselves or the magnitude of the forces experienced, even with extended practice. Subjects did adapt to the applied perturbation when the field strength was kept constant but still did not form internal models. Our results show that neither random presentation nor specific contextual cues are sufficient for learning conflicting internal models when the magnitude of the forces is also unpredictable. The data suggest that multiple conflicting internal models cannot be learned in all environments, and provide support for the unstable nature or limited capacity of motor memories.},

	abstract = {Studies of sensory-motor performance, including those concerned with changes because of age, disease, or therapeutic intervention, often use measures based on jerk, the time derivative of acceleration, to quantify smoothness and coordination. However, results have been mixed: some researchers report sensitive discrimination of subtle differences, whereas others fail to ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences even when they are obviously present. One reason for this is that different measures have been used with different scaling factors. These measures are sensitive to movement amplitude or duration to different degrees. The authors show that jerk-based measures with dimensions vary counterintuitively with movement smoothness, whereas a dimensionless jerk-based measure properly quantiﬁes common deviations from smooth, coordinated movement.},

	abstract = {Cognitive control” describes our ability to strategically bias information processing in line with internal goals. Traditionally, research has focused on delineating the sources of top-down biasing, implicating the lateral prefrontal cortex. The past two decades, however, have seen increasing interest in the regulation of control, that is, how learning processes guide the context-sensitive application of top-down biasing. Here, we review and synthesize recent research into the cognitive and neural mechanisms of this type of “context-control learning”. We ﬁrst discuss a fast-growing cognitive psychology literature documenting how speciﬁc cognitive control states can become associated with, and subsequently triggered by, contextual cues. We then review neuroimaging studies that speak to the neural substrates of contextual adjustments in control, with a particular focus on recent work that explicitly modeled context-control learning processes. We conclude that these studies suggest an important subcortical extension of the traditional frontal control network, as they indicate a key role for the caudate nucleus in forming associations between contextual cues and appropriate control settings.},

Here we outline and review an associative learning perspective on cognitive control in which control emerges from associative networks containing perceptual, motor, and goal representations. Our review identifies 3 trending research themes that are shared between the domains of conflict adaptation, task switching, response inhibition, and attentional control: Cognitive control is contextspecific, can operate in the absence of awareness, and is modulated by reward. As these research themes can be envisaged as key characteristics of learning, we propose that their joint emergence across domains is not coincidental but rather reflects a (latent) growth of interest in learning-based control. Associative learning has the potential for providing broad-scaled integration to cognitive control theory, and offers a promising avenue for understanding cognitive control as a self-regulating system without postulating an ill-defined set of homunculi. We discuss novel predictions, theoretical implications, and immediate challenges that accompany an associative learning perspective on cognitive control.},

	abstract = {Cognitive control is by now a large umbrella term referring collectively to multiple processes that plan and coordinate actions to meet task goals. A common feature of paradigms that engage cognitive control is the task requirement to select relevant information despite a habitual tendency (or bias) to select goal-irrelevant information. At least since the 1970s, researchers have employed proportion congruent (PC) manipulations to experimentally establish selection biases and evaluate the mechanisms used to control attention. PC manipulations vary the frequency with which irrelevant information conﬂicts (i.e., is incongruent) with relevant information. The purpose of this review is to summarize the growing body of literature on PC effects across selective attention paradigms, beginning ﬁrst with Stroop, and then describing parallel effects in ﬂanker and task-switching paradigms. The review chronologically tracks the expansion of the PC manipulation from its initial implementation at the list-wide level, to more recent implementations at the item-speciﬁc and context-speciﬁc levels. An important theoretical aim is demonstrating that PC effects at different levels (e.g., list-wide vs. item or context-speciﬁc) support a distinction between voluntary forms of cognitive control, which operate based on anticipatory information, and relatively automatic or reﬂexive forms of cognitive control, which are rapidly triggered by the processing of particular stimuli or stimulus features. A further aim is to highlight those PC manipulations that allow researchers to dissociate stimulus-driven control from other stimulus-driven processes (e.g., S-R responding; episodic retrieval). We conclude by discussing the utility of PC manipulations for exploring the distinction between voluntary control and stimulus-driven control in other relevant paradigms.},

	abstract = {The congruency sequence effect (CSE) describes the ﬁnding that congruency effects in classic probes of selective attention (like the Stroop, Simon, and ﬂanker tasks) are smaller following an incongruent than following a congruent trial. The past two decades have generated a large literature on determinants and boundary conditions for the CSE and similar, congruency-proportion based modulations of congruency effects. A prolonged and heated theoretical discussion has been guided primarily by a historically motivated dichotomy between “top-down control” versus “associative bottom-up” explanations for these effects. In the present article, I attempt to integrate and contextualize the major empirical ﬁndings in this ﬁeld by arguing that CSEs (and related effects) are best understood as reﬂecting a composite of multiple levels of learning that differ in their level of abstraction. Speciﬁcally, learning does not only involve the trial-by-trial encoding, binding, and cued retrieval of speciﬁc stimulus–response associations, but also of more abstract trial features. Moreover, these more abstract trial or event features can be both external, such as the spatial and temporal context in which a stimulus occurs, as well as internal, like the experience of difﬁculty, and the attentional control settings that were employed in dealing with the stimulus. From this perspective, top-down control and bottom-up priming processes work in concert rather than in opposition. They represent different levels of abstraction in the same learning scheme and they serve a single, common goal: forming memory ensembles that will facilitate fast and appropriate responding to recurring stimuli or events in the environment.},

One problematic aspect of the Botvinick et al. model is that there is no clear account of how the cognitive system knows where to intervene when conflict is detected. As a result, recent findings of task-specific and context-specific (e.g., item-specific) adaptation are difficult to interpret. The difficulty with item-specific adaptation was recently pointed out by C. Blais, S. Robidoux, E. F. Risko, and D. Besner (2007), who proposed an alternative model that could account for this. However, the same problem of where the cognitive system should intervene resurfaces in a different shape in this model, and it has difficulty in accounting for the Gratton effect, a hallmark item-nonspecific effect.

In the present study, we examined whether switching between abstract task rules and switching between response hands is associated with overlapping regions in the posterior lateral frontal cortex and whether switching between these two aspects of a task representation is neurally implemented by distinct functional brain networks. Subjects performed a cue-based task-switching paradigm where the location of the task cue additionally specified the response hand to be used. Overlapping activity for switching between abstract rules versus response hands was present in the inferior frontal junction area of the posterolateral frontal cortex. This region, however, showed very distinct patterns of functional connectivity depending on the content of the switch: Increased functional connectivity with anterior prefrontal, superior frontal, and hippocampal regions was present for abstract rule switching, whereas response hand switching led to increased coupling with motor regions surrounding the central sulcus. These results reveal that a rather general involvement of the posterior lateral frontal cortex in different switching contexts can be further characterized by highly specific functional interactions with other task-relevant regions, depending on the content of the switch.},

We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) during two set-switching tasks to test whether different component processes were responsible for (i) set initiation and reconfiguration when presented with the instruction to switch, and (ii) the implementation of the new set once subjects engaged in performing the new task. The response switching (RS) task required shifts of intentional set; subjects selected between responses according to one of two conflicting intentional sets. The results demonstrated the existence of more than one constituent process. Some of the processes were linked to the initiation and reconfiguration of the set prior to actual performance of the new task. Other processes were time locked to performance of new task items. Set initiation started with modulation of medial frontal ERPs and was followed by modulation over parietal electrodes. Implementation of intentional set was associated with modulation of response-related ERPs.},

Both types of switching induced similar behavioral shift costs. However, at the neural level, switching between stimulus categorizations led to left-hemispheric activations including the inferior frontal gyrus as well as the intraparietal sulcus extending to the superior parietal gyrus and the supramarginal gyrus. In contrast, switching between response modalities was associated mainly with left-hemispheric activation of the intraparietal sulcus and the supramarginal gyrus. A conjunction analysis indicated common activation of the left intraparietal sulcus and the supramarginal gyrus for both types of switching. Together, these results qualify previous claims about a general role of the left prefrontal cortex in task control by suggesting that the left inferior frontal gyrus is speciﬁcally involved in switching between stimulus categorizations, whereas parietal cortex is more generally implicated in the selection of action rules.

In this paper, we contrast two different kinds of task switching paradigms and provide evidence that different cognitive mechanisms underlie switching behavior depending on whether the switch is between sets of rules (rule switch) or sets of features presented simultaneously (perceptual switch). In two experiments, we demonstrate that behavioral effects (Experiment 1) and neural recruitment (Experiment 2) vary with the type of switch performed. While perceptual switch costs occurred when the alternative feature set was physically present, rule switch costs were observed even in their absence. Rule switching was also characterized by larger target repetition effects and by greater engagement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, perceptual switching was associated with greater recruitment of the parietal cortex. These results provide strong evidence for multiple forms of switching and suggest the limitations of generalizing results across shift types.},

This inhibition persists and impairs performance when participants switch back to this (still inhibited) task after only one intermediate trial. Previous task-switching studies on this issue have defined different tasks at the level of stimulus categorization. In our experiments we used different response modalities to define tasks. Participants always used the same stimulus categorization (e.g., categorize a digit as odd vs. even), but had to give a vocal, finger, or foot response (A, B, or C). Our results showed a higher reaction time and error rate in ABA sequences than in CBA sequences, indicating n − 2 repetition cost as a marker for persisting task inhibition. We assume that different response modalities can define a task and are inhibited in a “task switch” in the same way as stimulus categories are inhibited.},

In three experiments we confirmed this surprising asymmetry and investigated how it is affected by a reduction in the degree of interference between tasks. Experiment 1 progressively delayed the onset of the stimulus attribute associated with the stronger task. Experiments 2 and 3 separated the response sets of the tasks. Both manipulations reduced, without eliminating, interference of the stronger with the weaker task, but reversed the asymmetry of switch costs, resulting in a larger cost of switching to the weaker task. The results are interpreted in terms of a model of the interaction between control input, task strength, and task priming.},

	abstract = {Cognitive control is by now a large umbrella term referring collectively to multiple processes that plan and coordinate actions to meet task goals. A common feature of paradigms that engage cognitive control is the task requirement to select relevant information despite a habitual tendency (or bias) to select goal-irrelevant information. At least since the 1970s, researchers have employed proportion congruent (PC) manipulations to experimentally establish selection biases and evaluate the mechanisms used to control attention. PC manipulations vary the frequency with which irrelevant information conﬂicts (i.e., is incongruent) with relevant information. The purpose of this review is to summarize the growing body of literature on PC effects across selective attention paradigms, beginning ﬁrst with Stroop, and then describing parallel effects in ﬂanker and task-switching paradigms. The review chronologically tracks the expansion of the PC manipulation from its initial implementation at the list-wide level, to more recent implementations at the item-speciﬁc and context-speciﬁc levels. An important theoretical aim is demonstrating that PC effects at different levels (e.g., list-wide vs. item or context-speciﬁc) support a distinction between voluntary forms of cognitive control, which operate based on anticipatory information, and relatively automatic or reﬂexive forms of cognitive control, which are rapidly triggered by the processing of particular stimuli or stimulus features. A further aim is to highlight those PC manipulations that allow researchers to dissociate stimulus-driven control from other stimulus-driven processes (e.g., S-R responding; episodic retrieval). We conclude by discussing the utility of PC manipulations for exploring the distinction between voluntary control and stimulus-driven control in other relevant paradigms.},

	abstract = {The congruency sequence effect (CSE) describes the ﬁnding that congruency effects in classic probes of selective attention (like the Stroop, Simon, and ﬂanker tasks) are smaller following an incongruent than following a congruent trial. The past two decades have generated a large literature on determinants and boundary conditions for the CSE and similar, congruency-proportion based modulations of congruency effects. A prolonged and heated theoretical discussion has been guided primarily by a historically motivated dichotomy between “top-down control” versus “associative bottom-up” explanations for these effects. In the present article, I attempt to integrate and contextualize the major empirical ﬁndings in this ﬁeld by arguing that CSEs (and related effects) are best understood as reﬂecting a composite of multiple levels of learning that differ in their level of abstraction. Speciﬁcally, learning does not only involve the trial-by-trial encoding, binding, and cued retrieval of speciﬁc stimulus–response associations, but also of more abstract trial features. Moreover, these more abstract trial or event features can be both external, such as the spatial and temporal context in which a stimulus occurs, as well as internal, like the experience of difﬁculty, and the attentional control settings that were employed in dealing with the stimulus. From this perspective, top-down control and bottom-up priming processes work in concert rather than in opposition. They represent different levels of abstraction in the same learning scheme and they serve a single, common goal: forming memory ensembles that will facilitate fast and appropriate responding to recurring stimuli or events in the environment.},

The computational and neural mechanisms underlying this capacity remain poorly understood. We examine recent advances stemming from the application of a Bayesian learner perspective that provides optimal prediction for control processes. In reviewing the application of Bayesian models to cognitive control, we note that an important limitation in current models is a lack of a plausible mechanism for the ﬂexible adjustment of control over conﬂict levels changing at varying temporal scales. We then show that ﬂexible cognitive control can be achieved by a Bayesian model with a volatility-driven learning mechanism that modulates dynamically the relative dependence on recent and remote experiences in its prediction of future control demand. We conclude that the emergent Bayesian perspective on computational mechanisms of cognitive control holds considerable promise, especially if future studies can identify neural substrates of the variables encoded by these models, and determine the nature (Bayesian or otherwise) of their neural implementation.},

Here, we review and synthesize recent research into the cognitive and neural mechanisms of this type of “context-control learning”. We ﬁrst discuss a fast-growing cognitive psychology literature documenting how speciﬁc cognitive control states can become associated with, and subsequently triggered by, contextual cues. We then review neuroimaging studies that speak to the neural substrates of contextual adjustments in control, with a particular focus on recent work that explicitly modeled context-control learning processes. We conclude that these studies suggest an important subcortical extension of the traditional frontal control network, as they indicate a key role for the caudate nucleus in forming associations between contextual cues and appropriate control settings.},

	abstract = {Cognitive control covers a broad range of cognitive functions, but its research and theories typically remain tied to a single domain. Here we outline and review an associative learning perspective on cognitive control in which control emerges from associative networks containing perceptual, motor, and goal representations. Our review identifies 3 trending research themes that are shared between the domains of conflict adaptation, task switching, response inhibition, and attentional control: Cognitive control is contextspecific, can operate in the absence of awareness, and is modulated by reward. As these research themes can be envisaged as key characteristics of learning, we propose that their joint emergence across domains is not coincidental but rather reflects a (latent) growth of interest in learning-based control. Associative learning has the potential for providing broad-scaled integration to cognitive control theory, and offers a promising avenue for understanding cognitive control as a self-regulating system without postulating an ill-defined set of homunculi. We discuss novel predictions, theoretical implications, and immediate challenges that accompany an associative learning perspective on cognitive control.},

	abstract = {Cognitive flexibility refers to the ability to quickly reconfigure our mind, as when we switch between different tasks. This review highlights recent evidence showing that cognitive flexibility can be conditioned by simple incentives typically known to drive lower-level learning, such as stimulus–response associations. Cognitive flexibility can also become associated with, and triggered by, bottom-up contextual cues in our environment, including subliminal cues. Therefore, we suggest that the control functions that mediate cognitive flexibility are grounded in, and guided by, basic associative-learning mechanisms and abide by the same learning principles as more low-level forms of behavior. Such a learning perspective on cognitive flexibility offers new directions and important implications for further research, theory, and applications.},

One problematic aspect of the Botvinick et al. model is that there is no clear account of how the cognitive system knows where to intervene when conflict is detected. As a result, recent findings of task-specific and context-specific (e.g., item-specific) adaptation are difficult to interpret. The difficulty with item-specific adaptation was recently pointed out by C. Blais, S. Robidoux, E. F. Risko, and D. Besner (2007), who proposed an alternative model that could account for this. However, the same problem of where the cognitive system should intervene resurfaces in a different shape in this model, and it has difficulty in accounting for the Gratton effect, a hallmark item-nonspecific effect. The authors of the current article show how these problems can be solved when cognitive control is implemented as a conflict-modulated Hebbian learning rule.},

While there is generally acceptance that switching is subserved by a fronto-parietal network, there is a considerable lack of consistency across studies as to other brain regions involved in executing mental set switches. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study sought to determine whether paradigmatic design aspects such as stimulus complexity, motor response complexity, and stimulus ordering could account for the differences in reporting of brain regions associated with mental set switching across previous studies. Several brain regions, including the striatum and anterior cingulate, previously associated with mental set switching were found to be related more to resolving intra-stimulus interference conferred by increased stimulus complexity and increased motor response complexity than to executing the mental set switch. In considering stimulus ordering, deﬁned as the number of non-switch trials preceding a switch trial, brain activity was not observed in the fronto-parietal regions typically associated with switching but rather in regions in the anterior prefrontal cortex, sensorimotor cortex, and secondary visual cortices. Our results indicate that these important paradigm design aspects that are theoretically unrelated to set switching per se should be balanced and controlled for in future experiments, so as not to obscure clear identiﬁcation of brain regions truly engaged in mental set switching.},

It is possible that set switching consists of more than one component cognitive process and that the component processes might segregated in time. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) during two set-switching tasks to test whether different component processes were responsible for (i) set initiation and reconfiguration when presented with the instruction to switch, and (ii) the implementation of the new set once subjects engaged in performing the new task. The response switching (RS) task required shifts of intentional set; subjects selected between responses according to one of two conflicting intentional sets. The results demonstrated the existence of more than one constituent process. Some of the processes were linked to the initiation and reconfiguration of the set prior to actual performance of the new task. Other processes were time locked to performance of new task items. Set initiation started with modulation of medial frontal ERPs and was followed by modulation over parietal electrodes. Implementation of intentional set was associated with modulation of response-related ERPs.},

Both types of switching induced similar behavioral shift costs. However, at the neural level, switching between stimulus categorizations led to left-hemispheric activations including the inferior frontal gyrus as well as the intraparietal sulcus extending to the superior parietal gyrus and the supramarginal gyrus. In contrast, switching between response modalities was associated mainly with left-hemispheric activation of the intraparietal sulcus and the supramarginal gyrus. A conjunction analysis indicated common activation of the left intraparietal sulcus and the supramarginal gyrus for both types of switching. Together, these results qualify previous claims about a general role of the left prefrontal cortex in task control by suggesting that the left inferior frontal gyrus is speciﬁcally involved in switching between stimulus categorizations, whereas parietal cortex is more generally implicated in the selection of action rules.

In the 2nd part, we discuss findings on preparatory control mechanisms in task switching and theoretical accounts of task preparation. We consider preparation processes in two-stage models, consider preparation as an all-or-none process, address the question of whether preparation is switchspecific, reflect on preparation as interaction of cue encoding and memory retrieval, and discuss the impact of verbal mediation on preparation. In the 3rd part, we turn to interference phenomena in task switching. We consider proactive interference of tasks and inhibition of recently performed tasks indicated by asymmetrical switch costs and n-2 task-repetition costs. We discuss stimulus-based interference as a result of stimulus-based response activation and stimulus-based task activation, and response-based interference because of applying bivalent rather than univalent responses, response repetition effects, and carryover of response selection and execution.

In this paper, we contrast two different kinds of task switching paradigms and provide evidence that different cognitive mechanisms underlie switching behavior depending on whether the switch is between sets of rules (rule switch) or sets of features presented simultaneously (perceptual switch). In two experiments, we demonstrate that behavioral effects (Experiment 1) and neural recruitment (Experiment 2) vary with the type of switch performed. While perceptual switch costs occurred when the alternative feature set was physically present, rule switch costs were observed even in their absence. Rule switching was also characterized by larger target repetition effects and by greater engagement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, perceptual switching was associated with greater recruitment of the parietal cortex. These results provide strong evidence for multiple forms of switching and suggest the limitations of generalizing results across shift types.},

	abstract = {Task representations consist of different aspects such as the representations of the relevant stimuli, the abstract rules to be applied, and the actions to be performed. To be flexible in our daily lives, we frequently need to switch between some or all aspects of a task. In the present study, we examined whether switching between abstract task rules and switching between response hands is associated with overlapping regions in the posterior lateral frontal cortex and whether switching between these two aspects of a task representation is neurally implemented by distinct functional brain networks. Subjects performed a cue-based task-switching paradigm where the location of the task cue additionally specified the response hand to be used. Overlapping activity for switching between abstract rules versus response hands was present in the inferior frontal junction area of the posterolateral frontal cortex. This region, however, showed very distinct patterns of functional connectivity depending on the content of the switch: Increased functional connectivity with anterior prefrontal, superior frontal, and hippocampal regions was present for abstract rule switching, whereas response hand switching led to increased coupling with motor regions surrounding the central sulcus. These results reveal that a rather general involvement of the posterior lateral frontal cortex in different switching contexts can be further characterized by highly specific functional interactions with other task-relevant regions, depending on the content of the switch.},

	abstract = {Reverse alignment (mirror image) visualization is a disconcerting situation occasionally faced during laparoscopic operations. This occurs when the camera faces back at the surgeon in the opposite direction from which the surgeon’s body and instruments are facing. Most surgeons will attempt to optimize trocar and camera placement to avoid this situation. The authors’ objective was to determine whether the intentional use of reverse alignment visualization during laparoscopic training would improve performance. A standard box trainer was configured for reverse alignment, and 34 medical students and junior surgical residents were randomized to train with either forward alignment (DIRECT) or reverse alignment (MIRROR) visualization. Enrollees were tested on both modalities before and after a 4-week structured training program specific to their modality. Student’s t test was used to determine differences in task performance between the 2 groups. Twenty-one participants completed the study (10 DIRECT, 11 MIRROR). There were no significant differences in performance time between DIRECT or MIRROR participants during forward or reverse alignment initial testing. At final testing, DIRECT participants had improved times only in forward alignment performance; they demonstrated no significant improvement in reverse alignment performance. MIRROR participants had significant time improvement in both forward and reverse alignment performance at final testing. Reverse alignment imaging for laparoscopic training improves task performance for both reverse alignment and forward alignment tasks. This may be translated into improved performance in the operating room when faced with reverse alignment situations. Minimal lab training can account for drastic adaptation to this environment.},

	abstract = {Rapid reaching to a target is generally accurate but also contains random and systematic error. Random errors result from noise in visual measurement, motor planning, and reach execution. Systematic error results from systematic changes in the mapping between the visual estimate of target location and the motor command necessary to reach the target (e.g., new spectacles, muscular fatigue). Humans maintain accurate reaching by recalibrating the visuomotor system, but no widely accepted computational model of the process exists. Given certain boundary conditions, a statistically optimal solution is a Kalman ﬁlter. We compared human to Kalman ﬁlter behavior to determine how humans take into account the statistical properties of errors and the reliability with which those errors can be measured. For most conditions, human and Kalman ﬁlter behavior was similar: Increasing measurement uncertainty caused similar decreases in recalibration rate; directionally asymmetric uncertainty caused different rates in different directions; more variation in systematic error increased recalibration rate. However, behavior differed in one respect: Inserting random error by perturbing feedback position causes slower adaptation in Kalman ﬁlters but had no effect in humans. This difference may be due to how biological systems remain responsive to changes in environmental statistics. We discuss the implications of this work.},

	abstract = {In rule-based (RB) category-learning tasks, the optimal strategy is a simple explicit rule, whereas in information-integration (II) tasks, the optimal strategy is impossible to describe verbally. Many studies have reported qualitative dissociations between training and performance in RB and II tasks. Virtually all of these studies were testing predictions of the dual-systems model of category learning called COVIS. The most prominent alternative account to COVIS is that humans have one learning system that is used in all tasks, and that the observed dissociations occur because the II task is more difficult than the RB task. This article describes the first attempt to test this difficulty hypothesis against anything more than a single set of data. First, two novel predictions are derived that discriminate between the difficulty and multiple-systems hypotheses. Next, these predictions are tested against a wide variety of published categorization data. Overall, the results overwhelmingly reject the difficulty hypothesis and instead strongly favor the multiple-systems account of the many RB versus II dissociations.},

The model assumes that initially, rule-guided behaviors are controlled by a distributed neural network centered in the prefrontal cortex, and that in addition to initiating behavior, this network also trains a faster and more direct network that includes projections from sensory association cortex directly to rule-sensitive neurons in premotor cortex. After much practice, the direct network is suﬃcient to control the behavior, without prefrontal involvement. The model is implemented as a biologically-detailed neural network constructed from spiking neurons and displaying a biologically plausible form of Hebbian learning. The model successfully accounts for single-unit recordings and human behavioral data that are problematic for other models of automaticity.},
